# Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) program
The Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Condition after Wildfire (RAVG) program assesses post-fire vegetation condition for large wildfires on forested National Forest System (NFS) lands. RAVG data are produced by the USFS Geospatial Technology and Applications Center (GTAC) by way of a multispectral change detection process. Standard products are calculated using regression equations that relate derivatives of Landsat or other similar imagery to three estimates of burn severity: percent change in basal area (BA), percent change in canopy cover (CC), and a standardized composite burn index (CBI).

Standard thematic products include 7-class percent change in basal area (BA-7), 5-class percent change in canopy cover (CC-5), and 4-class CBI (CBI-4). National mosaics of each thematic product are prepared annually.

RAVG data are produced to assist in post-fire vegetation management planning. They are intended to enhance decision-making capabilities and reduce planning and implementation costs associated with post-fire vegetation management. RAVG analysis provides a first approximation of areas that may require reforestation treatments after a fire. This initial approximation may be followed by site-specific diagnosis and development of a silvicultural prescription to more precisely identify reforestation needs.

The stand-replacing fire is a fire in which most or all overstory trees are killed.


Fire behaviour refers to the manner in which fuel ignites, flame develops and fire spreads. In wildland fires, this behaviour is influenced by how fuels (such as needles, leaves and twigs), weather and topography interact. Once a fire starts, it will continue burning only if heat, oxygen and more fuel are present. Together, these three elements are said to make up the “fire triangle.” To put out a fire requires eliminating one or more of the fire triangle’s elements. Firefighters work to do that by: (1) cooling fuels below the combustion temperature through the use of water, foam, retardant or dirt; (2) cutting off the oxygen supply through the use of water, retardant or dirt; (3) removing fuel by clearing a swath of trees and brush ahead of the advancing fire.


There are three basic types of forest fires: (1) Crown fires burn trees up their entire length to the top. These are the most intense and dangerous wildland fires. (2) Surface fires burn only surface litter and duff. These are the easiest fires to put out and cause the least damage to the forest. (3) Ground fires (sometimes called underground or subsurface fires) occur in deep accumulations of humus, peat and similar dead vegetation that become dry enough to burn. These fires move very slowly, but can become difficult to fully put out, or suppress. Occasionally, especially during prolonged drought, such fires can smoulder all winter underground and then emerge at the surface again in spring.

For more than four decades, Canadian Forest Service researchers have been developing and refining several national systems for identifying where and when the risk of wildland fire is greatest. This work has played a crucial role in protecting Canadians, their property and forest resources. Among these, the main national system is the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System (CFFDRS). Tools developed to support the CFFDRS include:
- Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System (FWI) — a system used across Canada to assess day-to-day changes in the potential for fires to ignite and spread;
- Canadian Forest Fire Behavior Prediction (FBP) System — a system used to estimate potential fire spread rate, fuel consumption and fire intensity for a range of forest fuel types in Canada;
- Canadian Fire Effects Model (CanFIRE) — an extension model of the CFFDRS used to analyze the immediate physical effects of fire on stands and the resulting ecological effects on forest vegetation.

As well, government and university researchers have developed several fire occurrence prediction models for predicting the number of lightning-caused and human-caused forest fires in a given area.


higher slopes increase the rate of spread and intensity, but usually reduce the residence time of fire. Burn severity is expected to be more severe in coniferous forests
than in broadleaved forests [[Fernandes et al. 2010](#Fernandes2010)]. The pre-fire tree species composition could play an important role in determining post-fire reflectance and recovery and, subsequently, burn severity [[Dragozi et al., 2016](#Dragozi2016)]. Even more, the season of the year when each fire takes place is expected to influence the initial fire severity, and delayed vegetation response [[Fernandes et al., 2017](#Fernandes2010)].


## Life Zone
Although not widely used except in the Southwest, Merriam's Life Zones are useful to quickly characterize the different biotas seen at different elevations. Although the desert proper falls entirely within the Lower Sonoran Life Zone, mountain islands within the desert or bounding it often support one or more higher-elevation zones. Following is a brief (overly brief) rundown.

Lower Sonoran Life Zone—Encompasses what we normally consider desert and also desert grassland. El Paso is in the Lower Sonoran Life Zone. Typical plants include Black Grama (Bouteloua eriopoda), Lechuguilla (Agave lechuguilla), Creosotebush (Larrea tridentata), Tarbush (Flourensia cernua), and Ocotillo (Fouquieria splendens). Some typical mammals include Merriam's Kangaroo Rat (Dipodomys merriami) and Mearns Grasshopper Mouse (Onychomys arenicola).

Upper Sonoran Life Zone—Encompasses cooler grasslands (such as those in northern New Mexico) and woodland. Woodlands are usually open (that is, of widely spaced trees) forests of short trees or tree-like shrubs, usually less than 30 feet tall. The most common woodland in our area is pinyon-juniper woodland. However, pinyon-juniper-oak and oak-pine woodlands also occur within the boundaries of the Chihuahuan Desert Region. Generally, woodlands occur on shallower and topographically more diverse soils than the Upper Sonoran grasslands, though overgrazing and other mistreatments of the grasslands may result in invasion by woodlands. Some typical plants include Blue Grama grass (Bouteloua gracilis) and several species of piñon (Pinus) and juniper (Juniperus), the species involved varying with the geographic area. Some common mammals include the Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana), sometimes wrongly called antelope, the Cliff Chipmunk (Tamias dorsalis), and Black-tailed Prairie Dog (Cynomys ludovicianus).


Transition Life Zone—In the northern Chihuahuan Desert, generally Ponderosa Pine forest, though other pines occur at similar elevations farther south. The zone often includes Gambel Oak, particularly where burned or logged off, and Douglas Fir is an ingredient in the higher portions.

Canadian Life Zone—Spruce-fir forest, similar in overall appearance to the trans-Canadian spruce-fir forest, or taiga. Aspen replaces Gambel Oak as the main disturbance tree. This forest essentially is a boreal (northern) forest extending far south along the higher elevations of the Rockies and, south of the Rocky Mountains, into the northern desert region at high elevations of the Basin and Range mountains, such as Sierra Blanca and the Sacramento Mountains.

Hudsonian Life Zone—This and the following life zone occurs almost entirely north of our region at high elevations. As one nears the climatic timberline (either at high elevations or in the Far North), the coniferous forest trees become stunted (and a few different taxa appear). Sierra Blanca is considered by some to have a small representation of this zone.

Arctic-Alpine Life Zone—In the Southwest, this is the area above timberline (in the arctic, the area north of timberline), inhabited by grasses, sedges, and various herbs. We do not have representatives of this zone nearby (the nearest are in northern New Mexico). We frequently, as on Sierra Blanca, see extensive meadows without trees (balds), but these are not above true timberline (such balds usually are on westerly slopes—on north and northeastern slope, trees continue to the top of the mountains, indicating that cold temperatures are not limiting tree growth, as would be the case with true arctic-alpine conditions).
