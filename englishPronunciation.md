A **vowel** is a particular kind of speech **sound** made by changing the shape of the upper vocal tract, or the area in the mouth above the tongue. In English it is important to know that there is a difference between a vowel sound and a [letter] in the [alphabet]. In English there are five vowel letters in the alphabet.

The sounds of English are written with letters in the English alphabet, as either vowels or **consonant**s. All English words are written with vowel letters in them.

These letters are vowels in English:
A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

It is said that Y is "sometimes" a vowel, because the letter Y represents both vowel and consonant sounds. In the words *cry*, *sky*, *fly*, *my* and *why*, letter Y represents the vowel sound /aɪ/. In words like *myth* and *synchronize*, Y represents the vowel sound /ɪ/. In words like *only*, *quickly*, and *folly*, Y represents the vowel sound /i/.

It can also be a consonant sound called a *glide* as in the beginning of these words: *yellow*, *yacht*, *yam*, *yesterday*. Y is a consonant about 2.5% of the time, and a vowel about 97.5% of the time.

The letter W can sometimes be the second part of a vowel sound as in words like such as *cow*, *bow*, or *how*. In these words the vowel has the sound of /aʊ/. The letter W can be used as a consonant sound at the beginning of in the words *when*, *where*, *wet*. In some languages, like Welsh, the letter W represents the vowel sound /ʊ/, like *cwm*.

In written English the six vowel letters are used to represent the 13-15 vowel **sounds** (depending on the variety) in English. This means there are many more vowel sounds than letters in the English alphabet, and the English spelling systems doesn't always help us figure out what the English sounds are. This can be confusing.
* The rest of the letters of the alphabet are **consonant**s:
:B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y (sometimes), and Z.

## Monophthongs and diphthongs ##
Simple vowels are called **monophthong**s. The letters, like /ɪ/, are the International Phonetic Alphabet( IPA) letters for each vowel **sound** in English. In the IPA, each symbol represents a different sound, so using the IPA is helpful in pronouncing words.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="400" src="./notePic/IPA_English_Vowels_and_Diphthongs_with_Sound_Examples.svg.png"></p>

Common monophthongs in General American English include:

| vowel        | For example  |
|------------- | ------------ |
| /i/ | pol*i*ce, f*ee*t, *ea*t, sill*y* |
| /ɪ/ |*i*t, s*i*t, k*i*ck, m*y*th, b*i*tter |
| /ɛ/ | *e*nd, b*e*t, l*e*ss, l*e*tter |
| /æ/ | *a*t, *a*pple, f*a*t, m*a*tter |
| /ə/ | kingd*o*m, ph*o*togr*a*phy, ph*i*los*o*phy, ketch*u*p, h*u*ndred |
| /ɚ/ | butt*er*, coll*ar*, flav*or*, f*ir*m, b*ur*st |
| /ʌ/ | b*u*s, bl*oo*d, c*o*me, *u*p |
| /u/ | c*oo*l, t*u*ne, s*ou*p, kung f*u,* |
| /ʊ/ | c*oo*k, sh*ou*ld, p*u*dding, f*oo*t, r*ook* |
| /ɔ/ | *a*ll, f*ou*ght, h*o*t, b*o*t
| /ɑ/ | f*a*ther, w*a*lk, *a*rm, h*ea*rt, w*a*sp, l*a*ger, *e*nvelope, *aa*rdv*a*rk |

**Diphthong**s are a combination of two different vowel sounds, one vowel sounds turns into another sound as you say them. If you pronounce the words below slowly, you can hear the two vowel sounds of the diphthongs.

Common diphthongs in English include:
| vowel        | For example      |
|-------------- | -------- |
|   /eɪ/   | *a*te, r*ei*gn, v*ai*n, fl*a*vor, sl*ay*, conv*ey* |
|   /aɪ/   | *eye*, *I*, p*ie*, cr*y*, c*y*pher, cl*i*mb, l*i*me, l*i*ght, k*ay*ak, Th*ai*, h*ei*ght |
|   /oɪ/   |  b*oy*, m*oi*st, Fr*eu*d |
|   /oʊ/   |  t*oe*, r*ow*, g*o*, b*oa*t, m*o*de, chat*eau* |
|   /aʊ/   |  l*ou*d, h*ou*se, c*ow*, ab*ou*t, D*ao*ism, Mac*au* |

## Pronunciation of [i:]
Sound [i:] is a long close front unrounded tense vowel. It appears in words such as see[si:], or heat[hi:t].
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): The tongue is as far forward as possible in the mouth. The middle part of the tongue is curved, almost touching the roof of the mouth, while the tip is behind the bottom front teeth.
- Lip position: Lips are very spread, like in a smile. The corner of the lips are pulled wide.
- Jaw-dropping: The jaw is fairly closed, but the teeth do not touch.
- Length: [i:] is long sound.
- Tenseness: [i:] is a tense sound.

Common spellings for sound [i:] are: ee and ea, as in bee[bi:], or, as in easy['i:zi]; less common spellings are e, as in these[ði:z]; ey, as in key[ki:]; i, as in kilo['ki:loʊ]; eo, as in people['pi:pl].

For the method to pronounce the [i] vowel, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HuIAwQxEM4).

## Pronunciation of [ɪ]
Sound [ɪ] is a short near-close near-front unrounded lax vowel, as in it[ɪt], hit[hɪt].
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): The tongue is curved in the middle, but the tip is down, just behind the bottom front teeth. In this sound the tongue is not as close to the roof of the mouth as it is in sound [i:].
- Lip position: Lips are in a neutral position; the corners of the lips are still pulled back a little bit, but without tension.
- Jaw-dropping: The jaw is completely relaxed
- Length: [ɪ] is a short sound.
- Tenseness: [ɪ] is a lax vowel.

The commonest spellings for sound [ɪ] is i, as in six[sɪks], cinema['sɪnəmə], or dinner['dɪnər]; a less common spelling is u, as in busy['bɪzi].

For the difference between [i:] and [ɪ] in terms of the distinction tense/lax is explained, please referto the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qq7Rmbt7_qQ).

## Pronunciation of [u:]
Sound [u:] is a close back rounded long tense vowel, as in moon[mu:n], or use[ju:z].
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): The back part of the tongue raises toward the soft palate, while the front part of the tongue is down, just behind the bottom front teeth.
- Lip position: Lips take up a very rounded position, projected away from the mouth.
- Jaw-dropping: The jaw is closed and the teeth do not touch.
- Length: [u:] is long sound.
- Tenseness: [u:] is a tense sound.

Common spellings for [u:] are oo, as in boo[bu:]; oe, as in shoe[ʃu:]; ou, as in route[ru:t]; ue, as in clue[klu:]. This sound often appears in the pair [ju:] associated with spellings ew and u, as in few[fju:] and music['mju:zik].

## Pronunciation of [ʊ]
Sound [ʊ] is a near-close near-back rounded short lax vowel, as in put[pʊt], or book[bʊk].
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): It is a very similar position to that of [u:]. The back part of the tongue raises toward the soft palate, without actually touching it, while the tip of the tongue rests down behind the bottom front teeth. However, the difference with [u:] is that the back part of the tongue is raised less, and the tongue itself is not as back as before.
- Lip position: Again, the lips are rounded, but not as much as in [u:], where they are very much projected forward.
- Jaw-dropping: The jaw is closed and the teeth do not touch.
- Length: [ʊ] is a short sound.
- Tenseness: [ʊ] is a lax vowel. Both the tongue and the lips are less stiff than in [u:].

Common spellings for [ʊ] are oo, as in book[bʊk]. Notice that in general oo is pronounced as [u:], but the spelling ook is an exception and it is always pronounced as [ʊk]. Other common spellings are u and ou, as in full[fʊl] and would[wʊd].

## Pronunciation of [ɑ:]
Sound [ɑ:] is an open back unrounded long tense vowel, as in heart[hɑ:t], or palm[pɑ:m].
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): The tongue is really flat in the mouth. The back part of the tongue is pulled back in the mouth, but the tip is just behind the bottom front teeth.
- Lip position: Lips are in neutral position.
- Jaw-dropping: The jaw drops more than in any other vowel. The tongue presses down a little.
- Length: [ɑ:] is a long sound.
- Tenseness: [ɑ:] is a tense vowel.

Common spellings for [ɑ:] are ar and a, as in father['fɑ:ðər], or farther[ˈfɑ:rðər]

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="200" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation_ɑ.png"></p>

Fig. Manner of articulation of the [ɑ:] vowel.

For the method to pronounce the [ɑ:] vowel, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English]((http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWO6g9x-TgI)

## Pronunciation of [ɔ:]
Sound [ɔ:] is an open-mid back rounded long tense vowel, as in thought[θɔ:t], or caught[kɔ:t].
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): The tongue is more raised than in the case of [ɑ:] and is placed in the middle. The tongue as a whole is raised, that is, both the tip and the back part. The tongue is pulled back a little and the tip does not touch the teeth.
- Lip position: Lips take up the rounded position. The position for these vowel is less marked than in vowel [u:].
- Jaw-dropping: The jaw drops, not as much as in the case of [ɑ:].
- Length: [ɔ:] is a long sound.
- Tenseness: [ɔ:] is a tense vowel.

Common spellings for [ɔ:] are the following: a, as in all[ɔ:]; al, as in walk[wɔ:k]; au, as in autonomy[ɔ:'tɑ:nəmi]; aw, as in saw[sɔ:]; augh, as in caught[kɔ:t]; ough, as in cought[kɔ:t]; ar, as in warm[wɔ:rm]; or, as in born[bɔ:rn]; oor, as in door[dɔ:r]; ore, as in before[bɪ'fɔ:r]; or our, as in four[fɔ:r].

For the method to pronounce the [ɔ] vowel, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6fEHqj8U84)

## Pronunciation of [ʌ]
Sound [ʌ] is an open-mid back unrounded short lax vowel, as in hut[hʌt], or nothing['nʌθɪŋ].
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): The tongue is relaxed and slightly pressed down in the back. It is also flat in shape as opposed to other vowel sounds where the tongue is curled. As for height, it is raised a little more than in vowel [ɑ:], where the tongue is as low as possible.
- Lip position: Lips are in neutral position.
- Jaw-dropping: The jaw is in neutral position, near to rest position. It is not as open as in vowel [ɑ:].
- Length: [ʌ] is a short sound.
- Tenseness: This is a lax vowel, as attested by the tongue and lip positions.
- Sometimes vowels [ɑ:] and [ʌ] are confused. Apart from length and tenseness, jaw-dropping stresses some differences. Because of the jaw-dropping in vowel [ɑ:], the volume createdin the mouth for the air to go through is greater than in the case of vowel [ʌ]. That gives a different timbral quality to each vowel. Check the tongue positions out on the videos.

The commonest spelling is u, as in bus[bʌs], mother['mʌðər], or under['ʌndər]. Less frequent spellings are ou, as in month[mʌŋθ], and ou, as in country['kʌntri].

## Pronunciation of [e]
Sound [e] is an open-mid front unrounded short lax vowel, as in bed[bed], red[red]. Strictly speaking, the IPA symbol for this sound [ɛ]. Following authoritative dictionaries, such as the Oxford Dictionary and others, we will use the easier symbol [e] for this sound.
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): Since this is a front vowel the tongue is pulled forwards. The mid part of the tongue is raised towards the roof of the mouth. The tip of the tongue rests against the bottom front teeth. In the video an interested observation is pointed out. The tongue is somewhat widened, a feature not very often taken into account.
- Lip position: Lips are not rounded and are near the rest position.
- Jaw-dropping: The jaw is open a little.
- Length: [e] is a short sound.
- Tenseness: [e] is a lax vowel.

The commonest spelling is e, as in leg[leg], credit['kredɪt]. Other spellings are ea, as in dead[ded]; ie, as in friend[frend]; a, as in any[eni]; or ai, as in again[ə'gen].

## Pronunciation of [æ]
Sound [æ] is a near-open front unrounded short tense vowel [æ], as in man[mæn], or hat[hæt].
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): The back part of the tongue is raised a little; the front of the tongue stretches forward and presses behind the bottom front teeth. The production of this sound requires stretching of the tongue.
- Lip position: Lips are more spread than in the rest position but less than in vowel [i:].
- Jaw-dropping: The production of this sound requires a large opening jaw. This vowel will not sound natural unless the jaw drops as needed.
- Length: [æ] is a short vowel.
- Tenseness: This is a tense vowel.

The usual spelling for this sound is a, as in bat[bæt], or carry['kæri]. Many monosyllabic words with a are pronounced with [æ], such as bat, cat, fat, gap, hat, rat, or sat.

For the method to pronounce the [æ] vowel, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uc-4bPsST0)

## Pronunciation of [ɜ:]
[ɜ:] is an open-mid central unrounded long tense vowel, as in fur[fɜ:], or bird[bɜ:d]. In American English is always followed by a retroflex approximant, the so-called rhotic accent (see [Go12] for further information on rhotic accent).
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): As central vowel, the tongue raises towards the roof of the mouth in the middle and even touches lightly the top teeth. However, the tip of the tongue hangs down, but it is not close to the bottom front teeth. Again, the video makes an important point by remarking that the tongue is fattened.
- Lip position: The lips are slightly rounded, but not as much as in [u:] or [ɔ:].
- Jaw-dropping: The jaw is in neutral position.
- Length: [ɜ:] is a long vowel.
- Tenseness: [ɜ:] is a tense vowel.

Common spellings are: ir, as in first[fɜ:st]; or, as in word[wɜ:rd]; ur, as in fur[fɜ:r]; our, as in journey[dʒɜ:rni]; ear, as in early[ɜ:li]; or er, as in were[wɜ:r].

## Pronunciation of the schwa sound [ə]
[ə] is a mid central unrounded short lax vowel, as in about[ə'baʊt], interesting['ɪntrəstɪŋ]. The schwa always goes on an unstressed syllable. Partly due to vowel reduction, this is the commonest sound in American English.
- Position of the tongue (backness/height): The tongue is relaxed and flat, placed at mid height in the mouth. The back part of the tongue is slightly pulled back and the tip is just behind the bottom front teeth.
- Lip position: Lips are very relaxed and in neutral position.
- Jaw-dropping: The jaw is in a rest position without the teeth quite touching.
- Length: [ə] is a short vowel.
- Tenseness: [ə] is a lax vowel.

The schwa appears in many spellings; for example, in a, as in abide[ə'baid]; in e, as in fether['feðər]; in o, as in continue[kən'tɪnju:], or in u, as in supply[sə'paɪ],

# Consonant

In articulatory phonetics, a **consonant** is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are IPA, pronounced with the lips; [t], pronounced with the front of the tongue; [k], pronounced with the back of the tongue; [h], pronounced in the throat; [f] and [s], pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (**fricative**s); and [m] and [n], which have air flowing through the nose (**nasal**s). Contrasting with consonants are **vowel**s.

In fact, the English alphabet has fewer consonant letters than English has consonant sounds, so **digraph**s like "ch", "sh", "th", and "zh" are used to extend the alphabet, and some letters and digraphs represent more than one consonant. For example, the sound spelled "th" in "this" is a different consonant from the "th" sound in "thin". (In the IPA, they are transcribed [ð] and [θ], respectively.)

In General American English, /r/ when not followed by a vowel is realized as an r-coloring of the preceding vowel or its coda: nurse [ˈnɚs], butter [ˈbʌtɚ].

The following table shows the consonant sounds found in English. When consonants are shown in pairs, voiceless consonants appear to the left of the black bullet and voiced consonants to the right. Main allophones have also been included in the Table, which will be explained in detail later.

Fig. The upper vocal tract

## Stops
According to the organs involved in the closure of the oral cavity, stops are classed as follows:
- Bilabial stops: the airstream is held by using both lips. Bilabial stops are [ph], [p], [p˺], and [b].
- Alveolar stops: the airstream is held by pushing the tip of the tongue against the alveolar ridge. Alveolar stops are [th], [t], [t˺], and [d].
- Velar stops: the airstream is held by pushing the back of the tongue against the soft palate. Velar stops are [kh], [k], k˺, and [g].
- Glottal stops: the airstream is held by closing the vocal folds (remember that the space between the vocal folds is the glottis). Glottal stops are [ʔ] and [tʔ]. Sound [ʔ] is a pure glottal stop, not associated to any other sound, while [tʔ] is a co-articulation of [t] and [ʔ] (see Section 4.1.5subsubsection).

### Bilabial sounds [ph], [p], [p˺], and [b]
The closure of the oral cavity is carried out by the lips, which come together to stop the airstream. Then the airstream is held just behind the lips, and finally is released; see Figure 10. There are three voiceless allophones, [ph], [p], [p˺], and one voiced allophone, [b]. Spellings commonly associated with bilabials are p, pp for sound [p], as in pen[phen], happy[ˈhæpi], or lap[læp˺], and b, bb for sound [b], as in best[best] or robber[ˈrɑ:bər].

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="200" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation-p-b.jpg"></p>

Fig. Manner of articulation of bilabial stops [p] and [b]

In this video Rachel describes all allophones of phoneme /p/.

For the method to pronounce the B and P consonants, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45fGnSj8Fk)

### Alveolar stops [th], [t], [t˺], and [d]
In alveolar sounds the closure is produced by the tongue blocking the airstream against the alveolar ridge; see the follow picture. In order to do so, the tongue widens to seal off the oral cavity. It is the blade of the tongue that makes contact with the alveolar ridge; the tip of the tongue is in rest position just behind the upper front teeth. As in the case of voiceless bilabial stops, there are an aspirated and de-aspirated allophones.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="200" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation-t-d.jpg"></p>

Fig. Manner of articulation of alveolar stops [t] and [d]

Common spellings of phoneme /t/ are:
- t and tt, as in ten[then], stop[stɑ:p], or wait[weɪt˺].
- The past simple of a regular verb ends in phoneme /t/ when the last sound of the verb is a voiceless sound different from /t/: trip[thrɪp]PICtripped[thrɪp˺t], ask[æsk]PICasked[æsk˺t], laugh[læf]PIClaughed[læfth], toss[tɑ:s]PICtossed[tɑ:sth], mash[mæʃ]PICmashed[mæʃth]. Past simple endings are often aspirated to clearly distinguish them from other tenses. Past simple endings are seldom unreleased.
Spelling th, although less frequent, can be found, as in Thailand[ˈthaɪlænd].

### Velar stops [kh], [k], [k˺], and [g]
In velar sounds the closure is produced by the back of the tongue leaning against the soft palate, which blocks the airstream; see Figure 17. Similarly to bilabial and alveolar stops, aspirated, de-aspirated, and unreleased allophones ( [kh], [k], [k˺]) can be observed. When the stop is voiceless, sounds [kh], [k], and [k˺] are produced. If the stop is voiced, sound [g] results.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="200" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation-k-g.jpg"></p>

Fig. Manner of articulation of alveolar stops [k] and [g]

Common spellings of phoneme /k/ are:
- Letter c in word-initial, as in cat[khæt], and also within a word, as in fact[fæk˺t].
- Letter k in word-initial, as in keep[ki:p], and also within a word, as in like[laɪk].
- Combinations ck and ch, as in black[bæk] and school[sku:l].
- Combination qu, as in quiet[khwaɪət].
- Letter x, as in six[sɪks].

Sound [g] is normally spelled g or gg, as in girl[gɜ:rl] or egg[eg].

In the video below only [kh], [k], and [g] are explained.

For the method to pronounce the K and G consonants, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFxmh5y2y_M)

## Fricative sounds
In fricative consonants there is a partial obstruction of the air produced by placing two articulatory organs very close together. Normally, one of the organs is a passive articulator (see Section 2.2subsection) and the other is an active articulator (the tongue in most cases). The narrow passage causes a turbulent airstream, which produces the fricative sound. The sound produced by the turbulent airstream is called frication/fraɪˈkeɪʃn/. According to the organs involved in the partial obstruction of the oral cavity, fricatives are classified as follows:

- **Labio-dental sounds:** The frication is caused by loosely placing the upper teeth on the bottom lip. Labio-dental sounds are [f] and [v].
- **Dental sounds:** The frication is caused by placing the tongue between the upper and bottom teeth. Dental sounds are [ɵ], [∂], and [∂̞].
- **Alveolar sounds:** The frication is caused by moving the blade of the tongue near the alveolar ridge. Alveolar sounds are [s] and [z].
- **Post-alveolar sounds:** The back of the tongue forms a narrow passage with the hard palate (post-alveolar) that results in the frication. Post-alveolar sounds are [ʃ] and [ʒ].
- **Glottal sounds:** The frication is achieved by putting the vocal folds in a near-close position and letting the air go through them. [h] is the only fricative glottal sound in English.

### Labio-dental sounds [f] and [v]
The upper front teeth come close to the bottom lip, while the tongue is in rest position. The airstream is forced through the slit formed by those two articulators; see the following picture and video. Consonant [f] is voiceless and consonant sound [v] is voiced. Spellings f, ff, ph, and gh are frequently associated to sound [f]; see the following examples: first, coffee, photo, or cough. The only spelling associated to [v] is letter v.

### Dental sounds [∂], [∂̞] and [ɵ]
The tip of the tongue is placed between the upper and bottom front teeth, making loose contact. The air is forced its way through the narrow passage formed by the teeth and tongue, which causes the frication characteristic of these sounds. There is a voiceless sound [ɵ], and two voiced allophones [∂] and [∂̞]. The latter is used when a word is not fully enunciated (in particular in the context of consonant reduction). In [∂̞] the tongue does not go through the teeth fully, but just stays behind the teeth and presses them a little bit. This allophone is called a dental approximant. In the video in the following picture this sound is covered. Both phonemes /ɵ/ and /∂/ are associated to spelling th.

### Alveolar sounds [s] and [z]
Sounds [s] and [z] have the same manner and place of articulation; they only differ in voicing. Sound [s] is voiceless, whereas sound [z] is voiced. As for their articulation, the blade of the tongue is raised towards the roof of the mouth. The tip of the tongue rests just behind the bottom front teeth; see the following picture.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="200" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation-s-z.jpg"></p>

Fig. Manner of articulation of alveolar fricatives [s] and [z].

Furthermore, earlier on we defined sounds [s] and [z] as being sibilants. The tongue is thus curved along its medial axis, with its sides actually touching the alveolar ridge and forming a narrow passage or groove through which the airstream passes. That is the way this sibilant consonant is produced. Lips are parted and the corners pull back as in a smile. In Figure 25, we can see the articulatory gesture for [s] as in saw pronounced by Ladefoged. On the right, the solid line shows the position of the tongue, as extracted from x-rays, whereas the grey line indicates the position of the sides of the tongue, as given by palatograms. Between both lines, it is possible to imagine the exact tongue shape for this sound. On the left, it is shown a transverse view taken from the coronal section (indicated by the arrow on the left).

Fig. Tongue shape for alveolar fricatives [s] and [z].

Note that in the above picture the tip of the tongue is not exactly behind the bottom front teeth as described above, but just behind the upper front teeth. There are certain positional variation for the tongue in this respect.

Consonant [s] has a quite characteristic high-pitched, hissing sound that other similar [s]-sounds from other languages do not to have. For example, compared to the Spanish [s]-sound, some differences with respect to the English [s]-sound can be perceived. Spanish [s] is apical[ˈæpɪkl], that is, it is produced with the tip of the tongue rather than with the blade (these consonants are called laminal[ˈlæmənəl]). Some authors even speak of a little retroflex (curling back) of the tongue in the case of the Spanish [s]-sound, which would account for differences in timbre and pitch (Spanish [s] is perceived as lower in pitch than English [s]).

In the video below Rachel explains both sounds [s] and [z] and pays close attention to tongue and lip position.

### Post-alveolar sounds [ʃ] and [ʒ]
The two post-alveolar sounds take the same tongue position, [ʃ] being the voiceless consonant and [ʒ] its voiced counterpart. In these sounds the front of the tongue is curled (hence, the term post-alveolar) and approaches the roof of the mouth without touching it; see the following picture. The hard palate is a relatively large area. Here the tongue approaches the area immediately after the alveolar ridge (hence, the term post-alveolar) as opposed to palatal consonants, where the approximation takes place at the centre of the hard palate. Since it is also a sibilant consonant, the centre of the tongue forms a groove or channel. The sound is produced by the frication created when the airstream passes through that narrow passage. The tip of the tongue is relaxed and slightly touching the bottom front teeth. The lips are a little bit rounder to help channel the airstream.

Taken from the paper by Stone and Lundgerg, the tongue shape corresponding to sound [ʃ] is shown in the following picture. This is a 3-D reconstruction by using spline interpolation from 2-D measures on the tongue. The groove characteristic of this sibilant sound is quite noticeable. The air is directed by the tongue through this groove along plane A and perpendicularly to plane B.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="200" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation-Tongue-shape-sh.jpg"></p>

Fig. Tongue shape for [ʃ]. Anterior is on the lower left and posterior on the upper right.

The most common spelling for [ʃ] is sh, as in shop[ʃɑ:p]; less common spellings are: c, as in ocean[ˈoʊʃn]; ch, as in machine[məˈʃi:n]; or initial s, as in sure[ʃʊr]. As for the voiced sound [ʒ], which is rare in English, it is normally spelled s or si, as in usual[ˈju:ʒəl] or Asia[ˈeɪʒə].

Here we have Rachel’s video explaining the pronunciation of these two sounds.

### Glottal sound [h]
This is a complicated sound to describe from a technical point of view. By its manner of articulation it is classed as a fricative, although for some authors this sound lacks some basic characteristics of a consonant and is, therefore, treated as a vowel or a transitional state of the glottis. Here, it will be considered a glottal fricative. The sound [h] is produced by the vocal cords coming close together, without touching each another, and vibrating. Since the sound is produced in the larynx, the mouth position usually corresponds to the next sound in the word; see the video by Rachel below. In the video below around minute 0:45 we can see how the vocal cords produce sound [h]. Sound [h] is usually spelled h, as in here[hɪɻ].

For the method to pronounce the [h] consonant, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHoXdWW3bQI)

## Affricate consonants ([ʧ] and [ʤ])
An affricate consonant begins as a stop and is released as a fricative. In English there are only two affricate sounds, [ʧ] and [ʤ].

Sound [ʧ] is voiceless and sound [ʤ] is voiced. Both are the combination of an alveolar stop and a post-alveolar fricative. The IPA symbols indicate the combination of the consonant sounds ([t]+[ʃ]=[ʧ] and [d]+[ʒ]=[ʤ]). In the case of the voiceless affricate [ʧ], stop [t] is less aspirated than [th]; the manner and place of articulation of the post-alveolar is exactly the same as in [ʃ]. This also applies to the voiced sound [ʤ]. Common spellings for [ʧ] are ch, t, and tch, as in choose, question, or catch. In the case of [ʤ], its most common spellings are j in initial position, as in job; letter g, as in general; and combinations ge and dge, as in large and fridge.

For the method to pronounce the [ʧ] and [ʤ] consonant, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unfuGPc3iXo)

## Nasal consonants
In this kind of consonants the air can escape freely from the nose because the soft palate does not lean against the rear wall of the throat but just hangs loosely. Therefore, the air passes through the oral and nasal cavities. Nasal consonants in English are [m], [n], and [ɳ]. However, these consonants are actually stops and during the closure and blockage stages the air only escapes from the nose.
### Stops [m], [n], and [ɳ]
Consonant [m] is a bilabial stop, consonant [n] is alveolar stops, and consonant [ɳ] is a velar stop. They can be thought of as the nasal version of the oral consonants [b], [d] and [g], respectively. In Figure 33, the difference in terms of manner and place of articulation between sounds [m] and [p, b] can be observed. The soft palate is lowered allowing the air escape from the nose. These changes several features of the produced sound, as resonance, amplitude (it is lower than in stops or other consonants), and timbre.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="200" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation-m.jpg"></p>

Fig. Pronunciation of sound [m] as compared to oral bilabial stops

Sound [m] is usually spelled m or mm, as in more or comb. In the video below Rachel explains the pronunciation of this sound.

For the method to pronounce the [m] consonant, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Us15Wkh5lTo)

Apart from nasality, sound [n] is pronounced as [t] in terms of manner and place of articulation, that is, it is an alveolar stop. Sound [n] is usually spelled n, nn, or kn, as in not, sunny, or know. In the video below Rachel explains the pronunciation of this sound.

For the method to pronounce the the [n] consonant, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVakdwxGZ7Q)

Last nasal sound is [ɳ], a velar stop like [k] and [g]. In the following picture, phonemes [ɳ] and [k] are compared. In the case of [ɳ] the back of the tongue and the soft palate meet in such a way the nasal tract is not sealed off.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="200" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation-n-ng.jpg"></p>

Fig. Pronunciation of phoneme [ɳ] as compared to oral velar stops

Sound [ɳ] is associated with some fixed spellings:
- The ending of the present participle ing, as in eating[ˈi:tɪɳ].
- Letter n before k, g pronounced as velar stops is pronounced as ɳ, as in think[ɵɪɳk], or angry/ˈæɳgɹi/. Therefore, spellings nk are ng frequently associated with this consonant.

For the method to pronounce the [ŋ] consonant, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NduCJKb4iR8)

## Semivowels
### Palatal semivowel [j]
This semivowel is pronounced in a similar way to vowel [i:], but semivowel [j] is very short. Another difference is that in the case of vowel [i:] the tongue does not touch the roof of the mouth, while in the case of semivowel [j] contact is made. In the articulation of [j] the front of the tongue is raised and then the sides of the tongue touch the hard palate. A groove in the middle of the tongue is formed over which the sound travels. The tip of the tongue are down, just behind the bottom front teeth. Notice that [j] is a central consonant as the air is directed through the centre of the mouth. Sound [j] is usually spelled y, as in year[jɪr].

For the method to pronounce the [j] consonant, please refer to the video in [Rachel's English](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F8GAifCdVY)

### Velar semivowel [w]
It is articulated as a voiced approximant at the velum and at the same time is articulated with the lips. More precisely, this sound is termed as a labio-velar approximant[ˈleɪbioʊˈvi:lər] . The articulation of [w] is carried out as follows:

- The lips are projected forward and take on a rounded position.
- The back of the tongue is pulled back and raised and comes close to the soft palate. This position is similar to that of vowel [u:], but the back of the tongue is closer to the soft palate.
- The vocal cords then vibrate and the lips are retracted to the position of the next sound in the word.
- Because the tongue has to move up towards the soft palate, the root of the tongue also moves and narrows a little bit the pharynx. This gives the sound a characteristic timbre.
Sound [w] is usually spelled w or wh, as in way[weɪ], or where[weɻ]. In the video below Rachel explains the production of this sound and gives examples.
