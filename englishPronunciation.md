A **vowel** is a particular kind of speech **sound** made by changing the shape of the upper vocal tract, or the area in the mouth above the tongue. In English it is important to know that there is a difference between a vowel sound and a [letter] in the [alphabet]. In English there are five vowel letters in the alphabet.

The sounds of English are written with letters in the English alphabet, as either vowels or **consonant**s. All English words are written with vowel letters in them.

These letters are vowels in English:
A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

It is said that Y is "sometimes" a vowel, because the letter Y represents both vowel and consonant sounds. In the words *cry*, *sky*, *fly*, *my* and *why*, letter Y represents the vowel sound /aɪ/. In words like *myth* and *synchronize*, Y represents the vowel sound /ɪ/. In words like *only*, *quickly*, and *folly*, Y represents the vowel sound /i/.

It can also be a consonant sound called a *glide* as in the beginning of these words: *yellow*, *yacht*, *yam*, *yesterday*. Y is a consonant about 2.5% of the time, and a vowel about 97.5% of the time.

The letter W can sometimes be the second part of a vowel sound as in words like such as *cow*, *bow*, or *how*. In these words the vowel has the sound of /aʊ/. The letter W can be used as a consonant sound at the beginning of in the words *when*, *where*, *wet*. In some languages, like Welsh, the letter W represents the vowel sound /ʊ/, like *cwm*.

In written English the six vowel letters are used to represent the 13-15 vowel **sounds** (depending on the variety) in English. This means there are many more vowel sounds than letters in the English alphabet, and the English spelling systems doesn't always help us figure out what the English sounds are. This can be confusing.
* The rest of the letters of the alphabet are **consonant**s:
:B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y (sometimes), and Z.

## Monophthongs and diphthongs ##
Simple vowels are called **monophthong**s. The letters, like /ɪ/, are the International Phonetic Alphabet( IPA) letters for each vowel **sound** in English. In the IPA, each symbol represents a different sound, so using the IPA is helpful in pronouncing words.

Common monophthongs in General American English include:
- /i/ as in pol*i*ce, f*ee*t, *ea*t, and sill*y*
- /ɪ/ as in *i*t, s*i*t, k*i*ck, m*y*th and b*i*tter
- /ɛ/ as in *e*nd, b*e*t, l*e*ss, and l*e*tter
- /æ/ as in *a*t, *a*pple, f*a*t, and m*a*tter
- /u/ as in c*oo*l, t*u*ne, s*ou*p, and kung f*u,* 
- /ʊ/ as in c*oo*k, sh*ou*ld, p*u*dding, and f*oo*t, r*ook*
- /ʌ/ as in b*u*s, bl*oo*d, c*o*me, and *u*p
- /ə/ as in kingd*o*m, ph*o*togr*a*phy, ph*i*los*o*phy, ketch*u*p, and h*u*ndred
- /ɚ/ as in butt*er*, coll*ar*, flav*or*, f*ir*m, and b*ur*st
- /ɔ/ as in *a*ll, f*ou*ght, h*o*t, and b*o*t
- /ɑ/ as in f*a*ther, w*a*lk, *a*rm, h*ea*rt, w*a*sp, l*a*ger, *e*nvelope and *aa*rdv*a*rk

**Diphthong**s are a combination of two different vowel sounds, one vowel sounds turns into another sound as you say them. If you pronounce the words below slowly, you can hear the two vowel sounds of the diphthongs.

Common diphthongs in English include:
* /eɪ/ as in *a*te, r*ei*gn, v*ai*n, fl*a*vor, sl*ay*, and conv*ey*
* /aɪ/ as in *eye*, *I*, p*ie*, cr*y*, c*y*pher, cl*i*mb, l*i*me, l*i*ght, k*ay*ak, Th*ai*, and h*ei*ght
* /oɪ/ as in b*oy*, m*oi*st, and Fr*eu*d
* /oʊ/ as in t*oe*, r*ow*, g*o*, b*oa*t, m*o*de, and chat*eau*
* /aʊ/ as in l*ou*d, h*ou*se, c*ow*, ab*ou*t, D*ao*ism, and Mac*au*





In articulatory phonetics, a **consonant** is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are IPA, pronounced with the lips; [t], pronounced with the front of the tongue; [k], pronounced with the back of the tongue; [h], pronounced in the throat; [f] and [s], pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (**fricative**s); and [m] and [n], which have air flowing through the nose (**nasal**s). Contrasting with consonants are **vowel**s.

In fact, the English alphabet has fewer consonant letters than English has consonant sounds, so **digraph**s like "ch", "sh", "th", and "zh" are used to extend the alphabet, and some letters and digraphs represent more than one consonant. For example, the sound spelled "th" in "this" is a different consonant from the "th" sound in "thin". (In the IPA, they are transcribed [ð] and [θ], respectively.)


In General American English, /r/ when not followed by a vowel is realized as an r-coloring of the preceding vowel or its coda: nurse [ˈnɚs], butter [ˈbʌtɚ].

### Bilabial sounds [p] and [b]
The closure of the oral cavity is carried out by the lips, which come together to stop the airstream. Then the airstream is held just behind the lips, and finally is released.

## Semivowels
### Palatal semivowel [j]
This semivowel is pronounced in a similar way to vowel [i:], but semivowel [j] is very short. Another difference is that in the case of vowel [i:] the tongue does not touch the roof of the mouth, while in the case of semivowel [j] contact is made. In the articulation of [j] the front of the tongue is raised and then the sides of the tongue touch the hard palate. A groove in the middle of the tongue is formed over which the sound travels. The tip of the tongue are down, just behind the bottom front teeth. Notice that [j] is a central consonant as the air is directed through the centre of the mouth.
### Velar semivowel [w]
It is articulated as a voiced approximant at the velum and at the same time is articulated with the lips. More precisely, this sound is termed as a labio-velar approximant[ˈleɪbioʊˈvi:lər] . The articulation of [w] is carried out as follows:

- The lips are projected forward and take on a rounded position.
- The back of the tongue is pulled back and raised and comes close to the soft palate. This position is similar to that of vowel [u:], but the back of the tongue is closer to the soft palate.
- The vocal cords then vibrate and the lips are retracted to the position of the next sound in the word.
- Because the tongue has to move up towards the soft palate, the root of the tongue also moves and narrows a little bit the pharynx. This gives the sound a characteristic timbre.
Sound [w] is usually spelled w or wh, as in way[weɪ], or where[weɻ].
