A **vowel** is a particular kind of speech **sound** made by changing the shape of the upper vocal tract, or the area in the mouth above the tongue. In English it is important to know that there is a difference between a vowel sound and a [letter] in the [alphabet]. In English there are five vowel letters in the alphabet.

The sounds of English are written with letters in the English alphabet, as either vowels or **consonant**s. All English words are written with vowel letters in them.

These letters are vowels in English:
A, E, I, O, U, and sometimes Y.

It is said that Y is "sometimes" a vowel, because the letter Y represents both vowel and consonant sounds. In the words *cry*, *sky*, *fly*, *my* and *why*, letter Y represents the vowel sound /aɪ/. In words like *myth* and *synchronize*, Y represents the vowel sound /ɪ/. In words like *only*, *quickly*, and *folly*, Y represents the vowel sound /i/.

It can also be a consonant sound called a *glide* as in the beginning of these words: *yellow*, *yacht*, *yam*, *yesterday*. Y is a consonant about 2.5% of the time, and a vowel about 97.5% of the time.

The letter W can sometimes be the second part of a vowel sound as in words like such as *cow*, *bow*, or *how*. In these words the vowel has the sound of /aʊ/. The letter W can be used as a consonant sound at the beginning of in the words *when*, *where*, *wet*. In some languages, like Welsh, the letter W represents the vowel sound /ʊ/, like *cwm*.

In written English the six vowel letters are used to represent the 13-15 vowel **sounds** (depending on the variety) in English. This means there are many more vowel sounds than letters in the English alphabet, and the English spelling systems doesn't always help us figure out what the English sounds are. This can be confusing.
* The rest of the letters of the alphabet are **consonant**s:
:B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y (sometimes), and Z.

## Monophthongs and diphthongs ##
Simple vowels are called **monophthong**s. The letters, like /ɪ/, are the International Phonetic Alphabet( IPA) letters for each vowel **sound** in English. In the IPA, each symbol represents a different sound, so using the IPA is helpful in pronouncing words.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="500" src="./notePic/IPA_English_Vowels_and_Diphthongs_with_Sound_Examples.svg.png"></p>

Common monophthongs in General American English include:
- /i/ as in pol*i*ce, f*ee*t, *ea*t, and sill*y*
- /ɪ/ as in *i*t, s*i*t, k*i*ck, m*y*th and b*i*tter
- /ɛ/ as in *e*nd, b*e*t, l*e*ss, and l*e*tter
- /æ/ as in *a*t, *a*pple, f*a*t, and m*a*tter
- /u/ as in c*oo*l, t*u*ne, s*ou*p, and kung f*u,* 
- /ʊ/ as in c*oo*k, sh*ou*ld, p*u*dding, and f*oo*t, r*ook*
- /ʌ/ as in b*u*s, bl*oo*d, c*o*me, and *u*p
- /ə/ as in kingd*o*m, ph*o*togr*a*phy, ph*i*los*o*phy, ketch*u*p, and h*u*ndred
- /ɚ/ as in butt*er*, coll*ar*, flav*or*, f*ir*m, and b*ur*st
- /ɔ/ as in *a*ll, f*ou*ght, h*o*t, and b*o*t
- /ɑ/ as in f*a*ther, w*a*lk, *a*rm, h*ea*rt, w*a*sp, l*a*ger, *e*nvelope and *aa*rdv*a*rk

**Diphthong**s are a combination of two different vowel sounds, one vowel sounds turns into another sound as you say them. If you pronounce the words below slowly, you can hear the two vowel sounds of the diphthongs.

Common diphthongs in English include:
* /eɪ/ as in *a*te, r*ei*gn, v*ai*n, fl*a*vor, sl*ay*, and conv*ey*
* /aɪ/ as in *eye*, *I*, p*ie*, cr*y*, c*y*pher, cl*i*mb, l*i*me, l*i*ght, k*ay*ak, Th*ai*, and h*ei*ght
* /oɪ/ as in b*oy*, m*oi*st, and Fr*eu*d
* /oʊ/ as in t*oe*, r*ow*, g*o*, b*oa*t, m*o*de, and chat*eau*
* /aʊ/ as in l*ou*d, h*ou*se, c*ow*, ab*ou*t, D*ao*ism, and Mac*au*




# Consonant

In articulatory phonetics, a **consonant** is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are IPA, pronounced with the lips; [t], pronounced with the front of the tongue; [k], pronounced with the back of the tongue; [h], pronounced in the throat; [f] and [s], pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (**fricative**s); and [m] and [n], which have air flowing through the nose (**nasal**s). Contrasting with consonants are **vowel**s.

In fact, the English alphabet has fewer consonant letters than English has consonant sounds, so **digraph**s like "ch", "sh", "th", and "zh" are used to extend the alphabet, and some letters and digraphs represent more than one consonant. For example, the sound spelled "th" in "this" is a different consonant from the "th" sound in "thin". (In the IPA, they are transcribed [ð] and [θ], respectively.)


In General American English, /r/ when not followed by a vowel is realized as an r-coloring of the preceding vowel or its coda: nurse [ˈnɚs], butter [ˈbʌtɚ].

### Bilabial sounds [p] and [b]
The closure of the oral cavity is carried out by the lips, which come together to stop the airstream. Then the airstream is held just behind the lips, and finally is released.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="500" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation-p-b.jpg"></p>

## Fricative sounds
In fricative consonants there is a partial obstruction of the air produced by placing two articulatory organs very close together. Normally, one of the organs is a passive articulator (see Section 2.2subsection) and the other is an active articulator (the tongue in most cases). The narrow passage causes a turbulent airstream, which produces the fricative sound. The sound produced by the turbulent airstream is called frication/fraɪˈkeɪʃn/. According to the organs involved in the partial obstruction of the oral cavity, fricatives are classified as follows:

- **Labio-dental sounds:** The frication is caused by loosely placing the upper teeth on the bottom lip. Labio-dental sounds are [f] and [v].
- **Dental sounds:** The frication is caused by placing the tongue between the upper and bottom teeth. Dental sounds are [ɵ], [∂], and [∂̞].
- **Alveolar sounds:** The frication is caused by moving the blade of the tongue near the alveolar ridge. Alveolar sounds are [s] and [z].
- **Post-alveolar sounds:** The back of the tongue forms a narrow passage with the hard palate (post-alveolar) that results in the frication. Post-alveolar sounds are [ʃ] and [ʒ].
- **Glottal sounds:** The frication is achieved by putting the vocal folds in a near-close position and letting the air go through them. [h] is the only fricative glottal sound in English.

### Labio-dental sounds [f] and [v]
The upper front teeth come close to the bottom lip, while the tongue is in rest position. The airstream is forced through the slit formed by those two articulators; see the following picture and video. Consonant [f] is voiceless and consonant sound [v] is voiced. Spellings f, ff, ph, and gh are frequently associated to sound [f]; see the following examples: first, coffee, photo, or cough. The only spelling associated to [v] is letter v.

## Dental sounds [∂], [∂̞] and [ɵ]
The tip of the tongue is placed between the upper and bottom front teeth, making loose contact. The air is forced its way through the narrow passage formed by the teeth and tongue, which causes the frication characteristic of these sounds. There is a voiceless sound [ɵ], and two voiced allophones [∂] and [∂̞]. The latter is used when a word is not fully enunciated (in particular in the context of consonant reduction). In [∂̞] the tongue does not go through the teeth fully, but just stays behind the teeth and presses them a little bit. This allophone is called a dental approximant. In the video in Figure 23 this sound is covered. Both phonemes /ɵ/ and /∂/ are associated to spelling th, as in thanks[ɵæɳks], these[∂i:z], or Tell me the time[$t^helmi:∂̞əthaɪm$] (definite article the is often pronounced as the dental approximant).

## Alveolar sounds [s] and [z]
Sounds [s] and [z] have the same manner and place of articulation; they only differ in voicing. Sound [s] is voiceless, whereas sound [z] is voiced. As for their articulation, the blade of the tongue is raised towards the roof of the mouth. The tip of the tongue rests just behind the bottom front teeth; see Figure 24.

## Affricate consonants ([ʧ] and [ʤ])
An affricate consonant begins as a stop and is released as a fricative. In English there are only two affricate sounds, [ʧ] and [ʤ].

### Consonants [ʧ] and [ʤ]
Sound [ʧ] is voiceless and sound [ʤ] is voiced. Both are the combination of an alveolar stop and a post-alveolar fricative. The IPA symbols indicate the combination of the consonant sounds ([t]+[ʃ]=[ʧ] and [d]+[ʒ]=[ʤ]). In the case of the voiceless affricate [ʧ], stop [t] is less aspirated than [th]; the manner and place of articulation of the post-alveolar is exactly the same as in [ʃ]. This also applies to the voiced sound [ʤ]. Common spellings for [ʧ] are ch, t, and tch, as in choose, question, or catch. In the case of [ʤ], its most common spellings are j in initial position, as in job; letter g, as in general; and combinations ge and dge, as in large and fridge.

## Nasal consonants
In this kind of consonants the air can escape freely from the nose because the soft palate does not lean against the rear wall of the throat but just hangs loosely. Therefore, the air passes through the oral and nasal cavities. Nasal consonants in English are [m], [n], and [ɳ]. However, these consonants are actually stops and during the closure and blockage stages the air only escapes from the nose.
### Stops [m], [n], and [ɳ]
Consonant [m] is a bilabial stop, consonant [n] is alveolar stops, and consonant [ɳ] is a velar stop. They can be thought of as the nasal version of the oral consonants [b], [d] and [g], respectively. In Figure 33, the difference in terms of manner and place of articulation between sounds [m] and [p, b] can be observed. The soft palate is lowered allowing the air escape from the nose. These changes several features of the produced sound, as resonance, amplitude (it is lower than in stops or other consonants), and timbre.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="500" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation-m.jpg"></p>

Sound [m] is usually spelled m or mm, as in more or comb. In the video below Rachel explains the pronunciation of this sound.

Apart from nasality, sound [n] is pronounced as [t] in terms of manner and place of articulation, that is, it is an alveolar stop. Sound [n] is usually spelled n, nn, or kn, as in not, sunny, or know. In the video below Rachel explains the pronunciation of this sound.

Last nasal sound is [ɳ], a velar stop like [k] and [g]. In the following picture, phonemes [ɳ] and [k] are compared. In the case of [ɳ] the back of the tongue and the soft palate meet in such a way the nasal tract is not sealed off.

<p align="center"><img align="center" width="500" src="./notePic/americanEnglishPronunciation-n-ng.jpg"></p>

Fig. Pronunciation of phoneme [ɳ] as compared to oral velar stops

Sound [ɳ] is associated with some fixed spellings:
- The ending of the present participle ing, as in eating[ˈi:tɪɳ].
- Letter n before k, g pronounced as velar stops is pronounced as ɳ, as in think[ɵɪɳk], or angry/ˈæɳgɹi/. Therefore, spellings nk are ng frequently associated with this consonant.

## Semivowels
### Palatal semivowel [j]
This semivowel is pronounced in a similar way to vowel [i:], but semivowel [j] is very short. Another difference is that in the case of vowel [i:] the tongue does not touch the roof of the mouth, while in the case of semivowel [j] contact is made. In the articulation of [j] the front of the tongue is raised and then the sides of the tongue touch the hard palate. A groove in the middle of the tongue is formed over which the sound travels. The tip of the tongue are down, just behind the bottom front teeth. Notice that [j] is a central consonant as the air is directed through the centre of the mouth. Sound [j] is usually spelled y, as in year[jɪr].

Video. Rachel's English: How to Pronounce the Y [j] consonant

### Velar semivowel [w]
It is articulated as a voiced approximant at the velum and at the same time is articulated with the lips. More precisely, this sound is termed as a labio-velar approximant[ˈleɪbioʊˈvi:lər] . The articulation of [w] is carried out as follows:

- The lips are projected forward and take on a rounded position.
- The back of the tongue is pulled back and raised and comes close to the soft palate. This position is similar to that of vowel [u:], but the back of the tongue is closer to the soft palate.
- The vocal cords then vibrate and the lips are retracted to the position of the next sound in the word.
- Because the tongue has to move up towards the soft palate, the root of the tongue also moves and narrows a little bit the pharynx. This gives the sound a characteristic timbre.
Sound [w] is usually spelled w or wh, as in way[weɪ], or where[weɻ]. In the video below Rachel explains the production of this sound and gives examples.
