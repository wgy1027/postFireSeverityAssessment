Fire behaviour refers to the manner in which fuel ignites, flame develops and fire spreads. In wildland fires, this behaviour is influenced by how fuels (such as needles, leaves and twigs), weather and topography interact. Once a fire starts, it will continue burning only if heat, oxygen and more fuel are present. Together, these three elements are said to make up the “fire triangle.” To put out a fire requires eliminating one or more of the fire triangle’s elements. Firefighters work to do that by: (1) cooling fuels below the combustion temperature through the use of water, foam, retardant or dirt; (2) cutting off the oxygen supply through the use of water, retardant or dirt; (3) removing fuel by clearing a swath of trees and brush ahead of the advancing fire.


There are three basic types of forest fires: (1) Crown fires burn trees up their entire length to the top. These are the most intense and dangerous wildland fires. (2) Surface fires burn only surface litter and duff. These are the easiest fires to put out and cause the least damage to the forest. (3) Ground fires (sometimes called underground or subsurface fires) occur in deep accumulations of humus, peat and similar dead vegetation that become dry enough to burn. These fires move very slowly, but can become difficult to fully put out, or suppress. Occasionally, especially during prolonged drought, such fires can smoulder all winter underground and then emerge at the surface again in spring.
