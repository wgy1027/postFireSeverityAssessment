Fire behaviour refers to the manner in which fuel ignites, flame develops and fire spreads. In wildland fires, this behaviour is influenced by how fuels (such as needles, leaves and twigs), weather and topography interact. Once a fire starts, it will continue burning only if heat, oxygen and more fuel are present. Together, these three elements are said to make up the “fire triangle.”

To put out a fire requires eliminating one or more of the fire triangle’s elements. Firefighters work to do that by:

cooling fuels below the combustion temperature through the use of water, foam, retardant or dirt
cutting off the oxygen supply through the use of water, retardant or dirt
removing fuel by clearing a swath of trees and brush ahead of the advancing fire
