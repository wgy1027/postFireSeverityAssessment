课题还是需要解决实际问题。我关心：（1）小样本问题；（2）样本不匀衡问题；（3）已有经验模型的迁移问题。

## Few-Shot Learning
Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is a type of machine learning problems (specified by emperience E, task T and performance measure P), where E contains only a limited number of examples with supervised information for the target T.
FSL is applied in the following three typical scenarios:
- Acting as a test bed for learning like human. 
- Learning for rare cases. 
- Reducing data gathering effort and computational cost.
