课题还是需要解决实际问题。我关心：（1）小样本问题；（2）样本不匀衡问题；（3）已有经验模型的迁移问题。

## Few-Shot Learning
few-shot learning比普通机器学习的不同之处是它可以利用前验知识。
Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is a type of machine learning problems (specified by emperience E, task T and performance measure P), where E contains only a limited number of examples with supervised information for the target T[[1](#Papers)].
FSL is applied in the following three typical scenarios:
- Acting as a test bed for learning like human. 
- Learning for rare cases. 
- Reducing data gathering effort and computational cost. 

Some algorithms related to Few-Shot Learning:
- Transfer learning transfers knowledge from the source domain/task, where training data is abundant, to the target domain/task, where training data is scarce. 
- Imbalanced learning learns from experience E with a skewed distribution for y.
