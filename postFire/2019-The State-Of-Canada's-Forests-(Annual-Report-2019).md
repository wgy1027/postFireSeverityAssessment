# How does disturbance shape Canada's forests?
Canada's forests are periodically affected by natural disturbances such as fire, insects and drought. These disturbances can impact and renew entire forest landscapes and, over time, will influence forest composition, structure and biodiversity.

Natural disturbances vary in severity, extent and frequency. All together, these characteristics define the natural disturbance regime of a particular region. Natural disturbances constantly change Canada's forests and are part of a dynamic landscape.

**Natural disturbances vary from one region to another**

Natural disturbance regimes vary from one region to another within Canada. For example, spruce budworm outbreaks are most prevalent in the balsam fir forests of eastern Canada while wildfires burned more areas annually in the boreal forest and the taiga in central Canada. Some disturbances are specific to a particular tree species (e.g. mountain pine beetle affects only pine species) while others can affect the whole landscape (e.g. fires) thus resulting in specific ecological dynamics. Disturbance severity can strongly vary. with some being stand-replacing (e.g. crown fires) and others causing only partial mortality (e.g. surface fires).

**Disturbances have important ecological and socio-economic impacts**

Extensive stand mortality caused by natural disturbances can have succession through the release of nutrients from affected trees and the reduction of competition among surviving and newly establishing trees. Conversely, natural disturbances may have negative impacts on forest ecosystems or the people, communities and businesses who rely on forests. Exotic or non-native insects and diseases introduced through global trade (e.g. emerald ash borer, asian longhorned beetle) can have serious negative impacts because Canada's native forests may not be adapted to them. Also, fire poses threats to human safety, property and infrastructure. Natural disturbances can also temporarily communities and citizens.

**Disturbances affect the carbon cycle**
Forests play an important role in the carbon cyde as they absorb carbon as they grow and release it when they die, decay or burn. The impacts of natural disturbances are among the many complex factors that determine whether forests absorb or release more carbon each year.

**Natural disturbances are affected by climate change**
Virtually all natural disturbances are affected by dimate or weather conditions. Therefore, any change in dimate regimes can result in important changes to disturbance dynamics. For instance, rising temperatures over the last three decades have increased fire activity in Canada, especially in Western Canada. Future changes in precipitation may result in drought or floods and cause changes in the severity and frequency of insect and disease outbreaks. Impacts on Canada's forest and the forest sector could be significant, notably by causing timber supply shortages across the harvesting land base.

## Indicator: Forest insects
In 2017, 15.6 million hectares (ha) of forests were affected by insects.
- The spruce budworm in Quebec has become the dominant forest pest in Canada in terms of the area impacted.
- The area impacted by mountain pine beetle is at its lowest value within the past 10 years.
- Forest tent caterpillar continues to be an important defoliator of broadleaf forests in Quebec, Ontario and the Prairie Provinces.
- Western spruce budworm populations in British Columbia have reached the bottom of their outbreak cycle.

## Indicator: Forest diseases

Forest diseases are caused by pathogens. which are biotic agents that disrupt normal tree functions. Abiotic factors such as changing weather regimes, too much or too little precipitation, or extreme temperatures may affect their growth and development and can increase the susceptibility of trees to forest diseases.
- In natural settings, native diseases caused by native pathogens assist nutrient cycling, create habitat and enhance biodiversity.
- In commercial forests, diseases may be managed to prevent losses in tree volume and wood quality.
- Tree breeding and silviculture have been used to manage disease and optimize growth.
- Environmental conditions are important for morderating the interaction between the tree and pathogen.

## Indicator: Forest fires
In 2018, there were more than 7,000 forest fires in Canada, burning almost 2.3 million ha of forest, with both of these numbers close to twenty-year averages. Though the national totals are close to average, in 2018, many fires occurred in places where large fires are unusual, including Vancouver Island, the Manitoba Interlake region, and Parry Sound, Ontario.
- In british Columbia, a record 1.35 million ha burned, much of it in stands affected by the mountain pine beetle 8 to 12 years ago. Dead trees, both standing and fallen, dry after weeks with little rain, increased the fire intensity, making the fires more difficult to control.
- 2018 was the second year in a row with record-setting fires in the BC interior, but these fires were generally further from populated areas. However smoke darkened the sky and brought poor air quality to many towns and cities for much of August.
- 2018 was also the second year in a row with challenging emergency evacuations for remote fly-in communities in eastern Manitoba. Significant fire-related evacuations also occurred in BC, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador.

### Why is this indicator important?
- Forest fires are a threat to homes and businesses (e.g. tourism, logging, mining) in forested areas, trigger evacuations and disrupt people's lives and livelihoods.
- Forest fires produce large amounts of smoke. which affects human health and safety
- Over the last 10 years, an average of $1 billion has been spent annually on fire management.
- Although wildfires threaten human values, fire plays an important and beneficial role in forest health, succession and nutrient cycling.

### What is the outlook?
Forest fire occurrence varies greatly from year to year, both nationally and in any given area. However, there are factors that have caused fires to be more damaging and more difficult to control in recent years:
- Developments across the land base and the wildland-urban interface are expanding.
- There are more people living, working and visiting forested areas for recreation.
- There is a buildup of highly flammable forest fuels from drought and insect-caused mortality, as a result of climate change and other factors.
- Extreme weather events and shifting weather patterns associated with climate change increase the occurrence of drought and high winds - conditions ideal for fire spread.
