# How does disturbance shape Canada's forests?
Canada's forests are periodically affected by natural disturbances such as fire, insects and drought. These disturbances can impact and renew entire forest landscapes and, over time, will influence forest composition, structure and biodiversity.

Natural disturbances vary in severity, extent and frequency. All together, these characteristics define the natural disturbance regime of a particular region. Natural disturbances constantly change Canada's forests and are part of a dynamic landscape.

**Natural disturbances vary from one region to another**

Natural disturbance regimes vary from one region to another within Canada. For example, spruce budworm outbreaks are most prevalent in the balsam fir forests of eastern Canada while wildfires burned more areas annually in the boreal forest and the taiga in central Canada. Some disturbances are specific to a particular tree species (e.g. mountain pine beetle affects only pine species) while others can affect the whole landscape (e.g. fires) thus resulting in specific ecological dynamics. Disturbance severity can strongly vary, with some being stand-replacing (e.g. crown fires) and others causing only partial mortality (e.g. surface fires).

**Disturbances have important ecological and socio-economic impacts**

Extensive stand mortality caused by natural disturbances can have succession through the release of nutrients from affected trees and the reduction of competition among surviving and newly establishing trees. Conversely, natural disturbances may have negative impacts on forest ecosystems or the people, communities and businesses who rely on forests. Exotic or non-native insects and diseases introduced through global trade (e.g. emerald ash borer, asian longhorned beetle) can have serious negative impacts because Canada's native forests may not be adapted to them. Also, fire poses threats to human safety, property and infrastructure. Natural disturbances can also temporarily reduce the supply of timer, with socio-economic impacts on communities and citizens.

**Disturbances affect the carbon cycle**

Forests play an important role in the carbon cyde as they absorb carbon as they grow and release it when they die, decay or burn. The impacts of natural disturbances are among the many complex factors that determine whether forests absorb or release more carbon each year.

**Natural disturbances are affected by climate change**

Virtually all natural disturbances are affected by dimate or weather conditions. Therefore, any change in dimate regimes can result in important changes to disturbance dynamics. For instance, rising temperatures over the last three decades have increased fire activity in Canada, especially in Western Canada. Future changes in precipitation may result in drought or floods and cause changes in the severity and frequency of insect and disease outbreaks. Impacts on Canada's forest and the forest sector could be significant, notably by causing timber supply shortages across the harvesting land base.

## Indicator: Forest insects
In 2017, 15.6 million hectares (ha) of forests were affected by insects.
- The spruce budworm in Quebec has become the dominant forest pest in Canada in terms of the area impacted.
- The area impacted by mountain pine beetle is at its lowest value within the past 10 years.
- Forest tent caterpillar continues to be an important defoliator of broadleaf forests in Quebec, Ontario and the Prairie Provinces.
- Western spruce budworm populations in British Columbia have reached the bottom of their outbreak cycle.

## Indicator: Forest diseases
Forest diseases are caused by pathogens. which are biotic agents that disrupt normal tree functions. Abiotic factors such as changing weather regimes, too much or too little precipitation, or extreme temperatures may affect their growth and development and can increase the susceptibility of trees to forest diseases.
- In natural settings, native diseases caused by native pathogens assist nutrient cycling, create habitat and enhance biodiversity.
- In commercial forests, diseases may be managed to prevent losses in tree volume and wood quality.
- Tree breeding and silviculture have been used to manage disease and optimize growth.
- Environmental conditions are important for morderating the interaction between the tree and pathogen.

## Indicator: Forest fires
In 2018, there were more than 7,000 forest fires in Canada, burning almost 2.3 million ha of forest, with both of these numbers close to twenty-year averages. Though the national totals are close to average, in 2018, many fires occurred in places where large fires are unusual, including Vancouver Island, the Manitoba Interlake region, and Parry Sound, Ontario.
- In british Columbia, a record 1.35 million ha burned, much of it in stands affected by the mountain pine beetle 8 to 12 years ago. Dead trees, both standing and fallen, dry after weeks with little rain, increased the fire intensity, making the fires more difficult to control.
- 2018 was the second year in a row with record-setting fires in the BC interior, but these fires were generally further from populated areas. However smoke darkened the sky and brought poor air quality to many towns and cities for much of August.
- 2018 was also the second year in a row with challenging emergency evacuations for remote fly-in communities in eastern Manitoba. Significant fire-related evacuations also occurred in BC, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Newfoundland and Labrador.

**Why is this indicator important?**
- Forest fires are a threat to homes and businesses (e.g. tourism, logging, mining) in forested areas, trigger evacuations and disrupt people's lives and livelihoods.
- Forest fires produce large amounts of smoke. which affects human health and safety
- Over the last 10 years, an average of $1 billion has been spent annually on fire management.
- Although wildfires threaten human values, fire plays an important and beneficial role in forest health, succession and nutrient cycling.

**What is the outlook?**

Forest fire occurrence varies greatly from year to year, both nationally and in any given area. However, there are factors that have caused fires to be more damaging and more difficult to control in recent years:
- Developments across the land base and the wildland-urban interface are expanding.
- There are more people living, working and visiting forested areas for recreation.
- There is a buildup of highly flammable forest fuels from drought and insect-caused mortality, as a result of climate change and other factors.
- Extreme weather events and shifting weather patterns associated with climate change increase the occurrence of drought and high winds - conditions ideal for fire spread.

# How do forests benefit Canadaians?
Canadians across the country benefit from a vast array of economic, social and environmental outcomes from forests.

**Key contributor to the Canadian economy**

The Canadian forest sector provides quality, well-paying jobs to Canadians. Forthermore, it is a key economic engine for many communities across the country, including rural and Indigenous communities.

The sector directly employed 210,615 people in 2018 - forests, scientists, engineers, computer technologist, technicians and skilled tradespeople - and is responsible for an additional 91,874 indirect jobs in the rest of the economy. These jobs support 300 communities across the country. Many of these communities, often far from urban areas, would have few or no alternatives without the forest sector.

**More than a job provider**

Forests provide much more than jobs. Some of those other benefits might be harder to measure. But we know that approximately 11 million Canadians living in or adjacent to forested areas, as well as those living in urban areas, deeply value and enjoy forests.

Also, forests provide recreational and ecotourism opportunities for people living in both urban and rural areas and are important for cultural, aesthetic and spiritual reasons. More and more, remote communities across the country are taking advantage of local forest resources to support reliable and affortable bioheat systems and reduce reliance on diesel.

**Home to complex ecosystem**

Forest benefit Canadians environmentally with the rich ecosystem they support. This ecosystem preserves soils, cycles nutrients and supports biodiversity. Trees and other forest plants filter pollutions from air and water, acting as natural cleaner.

By absorbing and storing carbon, forests play a key role in the carbon cycle - the constant movement of carbon from the land and water to the atmosphere and living organisms. This cycle helps maintain the global carbon balance. In addition, forests can help moderate climate change by absorbing carbon emitted by human activities such as burning fossil fuels. Trees in cities and other urban areas also help improve air and water quality and reduce surface and air temperatures.

## Indicator: Employment
In 2018, Canada's forest sector employed 210,615 people, essentially stable (-0.34%) between 2017 and 2018.

## Indicator: Average earnings

## Indicator: Communities
Canada's forests are a rich source of economic, cultural, and environmental benefits for people across the country. These benefits are important to people and their communities in both rural and urban Canada.

**Why is this indicator import?**

- When a community relies heavily on the forest sector for jobs and income, any adverse economic events affecting the sector affects not only forest sector employees, but all members of the community.
- Forests provide more than just economic benefits. Forests are often central to the health and well-being of the people who living in forest-reliant communities, providing many environmental servies and recreational activities.

**What is the outlook?**

- Given the nature of the Canadian forest sector, some economic activities will always be located near the resource, away from urban areas. As a result, the forest sector will continue be an important source of jobs and income for communities across Canadia, including remote ones.
- Efforts to diversify forest products manufacturing will strengthen the sector and provide opportunities for Canadians, particularly those who live in rural areas.
- Strong demand for Canada's foest products will create new and diverse opportunities for people in forest-reliant, rural and Indigeous communities, as well as for people in other communities who benefit from living near forests and participating in the forest sector.
