**Forests cover nearly one-third of the land globally**

The world has a total forest area of 4.06 billion hectares (ha), which is 31 percent
of the total land area. This area is equivalent to 0.52 ha per person1 – although
forests are not distributed equally among the world’s peoples or geographically.
The tropical domain has the largest proportion of the world’s forests (45 percent),
followed by the boreal, temperate and subtropical domains.
More than half (54 percent) of the world’s forests is in only five countries –
the Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America
and China.
