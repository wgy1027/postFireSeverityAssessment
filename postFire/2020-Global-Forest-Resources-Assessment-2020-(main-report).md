# Disturbances
Forests are subject to many disturbances that can adversely affect their health and vitality, reduce their capacity to provide a full range of goods and services, and cause tree mortality. For FRA 2020, countries were requested to report on the forest area affected annually by disturbances, defined as any biotic or abiotic factor adversely affecting the vigour and productivity of the forest that is not a direct result of human activities. Specifically, countries were asked to report on the area of forest affected by insects, disease (caused by bacteria, fungi, phytoplasma or viruses) and severe weather events (e.g. snow, storms or drought) in the period 2000–2017. Reporting on the various categories of disturbances was exclusive and required that only the additional area of forest affected in a given year was reported (and not the cumulative total).

The baseline for reporting status was 2015, for which most data were available. The periods used for the analysis 20 The findings on fire presented in this box are based mainly on the Global Wildfire Information System (Artes et al., 2019) prepared by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission, the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 burned-area product (Giglio et al., 2018) and the Global Forest Change product (Hansen et al., 2013). Data on fire from FRA country reports, which were insufficient to produce global statistics, were used to estimate the proportion of burned area by ecological domain and compared with some of the results obtained from the aforementioned remote sensing products. of trends varied depending on the availability of data for the given disturbance category. Overall, however, relatively few data were available for this parameter and it was not possible, therefore, to accurately estimate the total forest area affected by disturbances globally (e.g. some countries that reported on one category of disturbance did not necessarily report on others). Moreover, although it may be easiest to report on this parameter on an annual basis, this approach has the disadvantage of not fully reflecting the magnitude of an outbreak (in the case of pests and diseases). For future FRAs, therefore, further discussion is warranted on how best to obtain and analyse data and whether more information is needed to properly assess this parameter.

In addition to the disturbances listed above, FRA 2020 includes analyses of forest fire (Box 7) and forest degradation (Box 8, p. 95).

## Insects

**STATUS**

Sixty-two countries representing 52 percent of the world’s forest area reported on the area of forest affected by insects in 2015. The total area affected was 30.2 million ha, which was 1.4 percent of the total forest area of the reporting countries (Table 72). The most comprehensive reporting was in North and Central America (98 percent of the region’s forest area), followed by Europe (95 percent) and Asia (47 percent).

The region with the largest forest area affected by insects in 2015 was North and Central America, at 20.4 million ha. The largest proportion of forest area disturbed by insects was in Asia: the 8.74 million ha affected in that region accounted for 3.0 percent of the total forest area of the reporting countries.

An estimated 524 000 ha of forest was disturbed by insects in Europe in 2015, which was 0.1 percent of the forest area of reporting countries.

On average, the forest area affected by insects in reporting countries was less than 2 percent in 2015. Nevertheless, ten countries reported that more than 2 percent of their forest area was so affected; the highest percentages were in the Republic of Moldova, at 19 percent, Uruguay, at 7 percent (although data were available only for planted forests) and Honduras, at 6 percent.

**TRENDS**

Thirty-six countries and territories, accounting for 25 percent of the world’s forest area, reported complete time-series data for the forest area disturbed annually by insects in 2000–2017. Given the low reporting and limited representativeness of the sample, the analysis of trends was confined to 2002–2016, a period with a relatively high percentage of reporting.

The average annual area affected by insects over the period was 29.1 million ha (in 44 countries representing 47 percent of the world’s forest area (Table 73). The lowest area affected in any given year was 23.7 million ha in 2011 and the highest was 35.3 million ha in 2013.

In the analysed period, reporting was highest in North and Central America (with reporting countries representing 98 percent of the region’s total forest area), followed by Europe (86 percent) and Asia (45 percent). Oceania and Africa had the lowest reporting, at 5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, and no complete time series was available for any of the countries in South America.

Of the three regions with the most comprehensive reporting, there was greater variability in the area affected by insects in North and Central America, where an average of 20.1 million ha was affected annually, ranging from 14.7 million ha in 2011 to 25.9 million ha in 2013. The peak in 2013 was due to a massive attack in Canada of defoliator insects, mainly the forest tent caterpillar. According to Canada’s country report, forest tent caterpillar outbreaks follow a well-established pattern of occurrence about every 11 years; comparable peaks in the area defoliated by this insect were observed in 1990–1991 and 2000–2001. The average area affected by insects in Europe in 2002–2016 was 506 000 ha per year and the average in Asia was 8.42 million ha per year.

## Diseases

**STATUS**

Fifty-one countries representing 42 percent of the total forest area reported data on the area of forest affected by disease in 2015. The total area so affected was 6.60 million ha, which was 0.4 percent of the forest area of the reporting countries (Table 74). The most data on this parameter was for Europe, where the reporting countries represented 96 percent of the region’s forest area, followed by North and Central America (50 percent) and Asia (38 percent).

North and Central America reported the largest area of forest affected by disease in 2015, at 3.75 million ha (1 percent of the forest area of the region’s reporting countries), followed by Asia and Europe.

**TRENDS**

Thirty countries and territories, representing 24 percent of the forest area, reported complete time-series data for the forest area affected by disease in 2000–2017. More comprehensive reporting was available for 2002–2017, with data provided by 33 countries representing 37 percent of the world’s forest area. Coverage in this period was highest in Europe, with reporting countries accounting for 86 percent of the region’s forest area, followed by North and Central America (50 percent), Asia (38 percent), Oceania (5 percent) and Africa (3 percent); no countries or territories in South America provided complete time series for the analysed period.

The average forest area affected by disease in reporting countries in 2002–2017 was 4.76 million ha, with a low of 2.18 million ha in 2002 and a high of 6.63 million ha in 2011 (Table 75).

Of the three regions with the highest reporting, North and Central America had the highest variability in the area affected by disease, with a low of 877 000 ha in 2002, a high of 5.13 million ha in 2011 and an average of 3.26 million ha. The area of forest affected by disease was relatively stable over the period in Asia and Europe.

## Severe weather events

**STATUS**

Forty-eight countries and territories representing 37 percent of the total forest area reported data on the area of forest affected by severe weather events in 2015. The total area affected was 3.83 million ha, which was 0.3 percent of the forest area of the reporting countries.

The most comprehensive reporting of the forest area disturbed by severe weather events was in Europe (95 percent of the region’s forest area), followed by North and Central America (50 percent); reporting was below 10 percent in the other regions.

Among the regions, North and Central America reported the largest area of forest affected by severe weather events in 2015, at 2.08 million ha (0.5 percent of the forest area of reporting countries in the region). The second-largest area was in Europe, at 866 000 ha (0.1 percent) (Table 76).

**TRENDS**

Thirty-two countries and territories representing 24 percent of the world’s forest area reported annual data on the area of forest affected by severe weather events in 2000–2017. The analysis presented here is for 2002–2015, with data for 37 countries and territories representing 33 percent of the world’s forest area. Reporting was highest in Europe, with reporting countries accounting for 87 percent of the region’s forest area, followed by North and Central America (50 percent), Asia (8 percent) Oceania (5 percent) and Africa (3 percent). No countries or territories in South America provided complete time series for the analysed period.

The average forest area affected by severe weather events globally over the period was 5.96 million ha, with a high of 9.38 million ha in 2006 and a low of 2.79 million ha in 2015 (Table 77).

The area affected varied considerably over time, especially in North and Central America, where it ranged from a high of 9.08 million ha in 2006 to a low of 2.08 million ha in 2015; the annual average in that region was 5.48 million ha. In Europe, the highest yearly value was 784 000 ha in 2005, the lowest was 230 000 ha in 2006, and the annual average was 332 000 ha.
