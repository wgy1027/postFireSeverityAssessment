# Introduction

# The State of Forest Ecosystems
**key messages:**
- Forests cover 31 percent of the global land area. Approximately half the forest area is relatively intact, and more than one-third is primary forest.
- The net loss of forest area has decreased substantially since 1990, but deforestation and forest degradation continue to take place at alarming rates resulting in significant loss of biodiversity.
- The world is not on track to meet the target of the United Nations Strategic Plan for Forests to increase forest area by 3 percent worldwide by 2030.

# Forest Species and Genetic Diversity
**Key messages:**
- Forests harbour most of Earth’s terrestrial biodiversity. The conservation of the world’s biodiversity is thus utterly dependent on the way in which we interact with and use the world’s forests.
- The biodiversity of forests varies considerably according to factors such as forest type, geography, climate and soils – in addition to human use.
- Progress on preventing the extinction of known threatened species and improving their conservation status has been slow.


# People, Biodiversity and Forests
**Key messages:**
- All people depend upon forests and their biodiversity, some more than others.
- Feeding humanity and conserving and sustainably using ecosystems are complementary and closely interdependent goals.
- Human health and well-being are closely associated with forests.

# Reversing Deforestation and Forest Degradation
**Key messages:**
- Agricultural expansion continues to be the main driver of deforestation and forest fragmentation and the associated loss of forest biodiversity.
- Actions to combat deforestation and illegal logging have gathered pace over the past decade – as have international agreements and results-based payments.
- Large-scale forest restoration is needed to meet the SDGs and to prevent, halt and reverse the loss of biodiversity.

# Conservation and Sustainable Use of Forests and Forest Biodiversity
**Key messages:**
- Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 (to protect at least 17 percent of terrestrial area by 2020) has been exceeded for forest ecosystems as a whole. However, protected areas alone are not sufficient to conserve biodiversity.
- Aichi Biodiversity Target 7 (by 2020, areas under agriculture, aquaculture and forestry are managed sustainably, ensuring conservation) has not been met for forests, but the management of the world’s forests is improving.
- Solutions that balance conservation and sustainable use of forest biodiversity are critical – and possible.
