CHAPTER 2 THE STATE OF FOREST ECOSYSTEMS Key messages 1Forests cover 31 percent of the global land area. Approximately half the forest area is relatively intact, and more than one-third is primary forest. 2 The net loss of forest area has decreased substantially since 1990, but deforestation and forest degradation continue to take place at alarming rates resulting in significant loss of biodiversity. 3 The world is not on track to meet the target of the United Nations Strategic Plan for Forests to increase forest area by 3 percent worldwide by 2030.
