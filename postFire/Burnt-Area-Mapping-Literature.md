## The Collection 6 MODIS burned area mapping algorithm and product
Year: 2018

Main content: 
Here, the authors describe refinements made to the 500m global burned area mapping algorithm that were implemented in late 2016 as part of the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) land-product reprocessing. The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas.

With the aim of continuous monitoring of annual burned areas using Landsat time series, we developed an algorithm based on burned pixel detection using harmonic model which is fitting with Landsat time series and breakpoint identification in the time series data.

## A VIIRS direct broadcast algorithm for rapid response mapping of wildfire burned area in the western United States
Year: 2018

Main content: 
We present a direct broadcast (DB) rapid response burned area mapping algorithm for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data that combines products driven by the spectral signal of fire-affected areas from both emissive and reflective spectral bands. The algorithm processes VIIRS infrared M-bands (750 m) using spectral ratios of the top of atmosphere reflectance from a single satellite scene to identify pixels exhibiting surface properties consistent with burn scars. Next, this collection of candidate burn scar pixels is screened using a contextual filter based on VIIRS I-band (375 m) active fire detections (AFD) which removes erroneously classified pixels and provides burn scar detections (BSD). The AFD and BSD are then resampled to a 375 m grid and reported jointly as VIIRS burned area (VBA).

## A data mining approach for global burned area mapping
Year: 2018

Main content: 
This work explores how four different classification algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN) and a well-known decision tree algorithm (C5.0), for classifying burned areas at global scale through a data mining methodology using 2008 MODIS data. A training database consisting of burned and unburned pixels was created from 130 Landsat scenes. The ability of the algorithms to cope with hightly unbalanced database was evaluated. Attribute selection was performed using three filters to remove potential noise and to reduce the dimensionality of the data: Random Forest, entropy-based filter, and logistic regression. Models were trained using an 80% of the database following a ten-fold approach to reduce possible overfitting and to select the optimum parameters. Finally, the performance fo the algorithms was evaluated over six different regions using official statistics where they are available and benchmark burned area products, namely MCD45 (V5.1) and MCD64 (V6).

## Mapping burned areas using dense time-series of Landsat data
Year: 2017

Main content: 
In this paper, the authors present an algorithm that identifies burned areas in dense time-series of Landsat data to produce the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) products. The algorithm uses gradient boosted regression models to generate burn probability surfaces using band values and spectral indices from individual Landsat scenes, lagged reference conditions, and change metrics between the scene and reference predictors. Burn classifications are generated from the burn probability surfaces using pixel-level thresholding in combination with a region growing process. 

## Assessment of VIIRS 375 m active fire detection product for direct burned area mapping
Year: 2017

In this study, we apply that VIIRS 375m active fire detection product and assess its performance for direct burned area estimation. Consecutive VIIRS 375 m active fire detections were aggregated to produce the VIIRS 375 m burned area (BA) estimation over ten ecologically diverse study areas. The accuracy of the burned area estimations was assessed by comparison with Landsat-8 supervised burned area classification.

## Mapping a burned forest area from Landsat TM data by multiple methods
Year: 2016

In this study, focusing on the most serious forest fire in the history of P. R. China which occurred in this region, we made use of two Landsat-5 TM (Thematic Mapper) images, and proposed to map the overall burned area and burned forest area by multiple methods. During the mapping, the fire perimeter, as well as rivers, roads and urban areas were first extracted and masked visually, and then four indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Vegetation Fractional Cover and Disturbance Index were calculated. For each index, the optimal threshold for separating burned from unburned forest area was determined using their histograms. For comparison, threshold segmentation using single-band reflectance was performed, in addition to a Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) based supervised classification of all features and forest area alone; their accuracies were also evaluated and analysed.

Year: 2011

Main content: 
Here, we present an algorithm that is used to derive burned areas by blending active fire observations from multiple satellites which are provided in the Hazard Mapping System (HMS). The HMS consolidates automated fire detections from Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) Imager, Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS).
