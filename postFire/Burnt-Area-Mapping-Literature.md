## The Collection 6 MODIS burned area mapping algorithm and product
Year: 2018

Main content: 
Here, the authors describe refinements made to the 500m global burned area mapping algorithm that were implemented in late 2016 as part of the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) land-product reprocessing. The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas.

## Burned area detection based on Landsat time series in savannas of southern Burkina Faso

Main content: 
With the aim of continuous monitoring of annual burned areas using Landsat time series, we developed an algorithm based on burned pixel detection using harmonic model which is fitting with Landsat time series and breakpoint identification in the time series data.

## A VIIRS direct broadcast algorithm for rapid response mapping of wildfire burned area in the western United States

Year: 2018

We present a direct broadcast (DB) rapid response burned area mapping algorithm for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data that combines products driven by the spectral signal of fire-affected areas from both emissive and reflective spectral bands. The algorithm processes VIIRS infrared M-bands (750 m) using spectral ratios of the top of atmosphere reflectance from a single satellite scene to identify pixels exhibiting surface properties consistent with burn scars. Next, this collection of candidate burn scar pixels is screened using a contextual filter based on VIIRS I-band (375 m) active fire detections (AFD) which removes erroneously classified pixels and provides burn scar detections (BSD). The AFD and BSD are then resampled to a 375 m grid and reported jointly as VIIRS burned area (VBA).

## A data mining approach for global burned area mapping
Year: 2018

Main content: 
This work explores how four different classification algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN) and a well-known decision tree algorithm (C5.0), for classifying burned areas at global scale through a data mining methodology using 2008 MODIS data. A training database consisting of burned and unburned pixels was created from 130 Landsat scenes. The ability of the algorithms to cope with hightly unbalanced database was evaluated. Attribute selection was performed using three filters to remove potential noise and to reduce the dimensionality of the data: Random Forest, entropy-based filter, and logistic regression. Models were trained using an 80% of the database following a ten-fold approach to reduce possible overfitting and to select the optimum parameters. Finally, the performance fo the algorithms was evaluated over six different regions using official statistics where they are available and benchmark burned area products, namely MCD45 (V5.1) and MCD64 (V6).


## Mapping burned areas using dense time-series of Landsat data
Year: 2017

Main content: 
In this paper, the authors present an algorithm that identifies burned areas in dense time-series of Landsat data to produce the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) products. The algorithm uses gradient boosted regression models to generate burn probability surfaces using band values and spectral indices from individual Landsat scenes, lagged reference conditions, and change metrics between the scene and reference predictors. Burn classifications are generated from the burn probability surfaces using pixel-level thresholding in combination with a region growing process. 

## Assessment of VIIRS 375 m active fire detection product for direct burned area mapping
Year: 2017

In this study, we apply that VIIRS 375m active fire detection product and assess its performance for direct burned area estimation. Consecutive VIIRS 375 m active fire detections were aggregated to produce the VIIRS 375 m burned area (BA) estimation over ten ecologically diverse study areas. The accuracy of the burned area estimations was assessed by comparison with Landsat-8 supervised burned area classification.
