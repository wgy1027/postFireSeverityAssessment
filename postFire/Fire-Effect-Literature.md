## Economic Assessment of Fire Damage to Urban Forest in the Wildland–Urban Interface Using Planet Satellites Constellation Images
Year: 2018 bad

we take advantage of frequent (i.e., ca. daily), high-spatial-resolution (3 m) imagery acquired from a constellation of nano-satellites operated by Planet Labs (“Planet”) to assess fire damage to urban trees in the wildland-urban interface of a Mediterranean city in Israel (Haifa).

## Testing a Landsat-based approach for mapping disturbance causality in U.S. forests
Year: 2017

In this study, a two-step modeling approach was used to map the type and timing of forest disturbances occurring between 1984 and 2010 in ten Landsat scenes located in diverse forest systems of the conterminous U.S. In step one, Random Forest (RF) models were developed to predict the presence of five forest disturbance agents (conversion, fire, harvest, stress and wind) and stable (i.e. undisturbed) forest. Models were developed using a suite of predictors including spectral change metrics derived from a nonparametric shape-restricted spline fitting algorithm, as well as several topographic and biophysical variables which potentially influence the initiation and/or spread of forest disturbance agents. Step two involved applying a rule-based model to the spectrally-based shape parameters (e.g. shape type, year and duration) to assign a year to the disturbance types and locations predicted in step one.
