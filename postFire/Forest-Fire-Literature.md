## A survey on technologies for automatic forest fire monitoring, detection, and fighting using unmanned aerial vehicles and remote sensing techniques
Year: 2015

Main content: 
This paper presents a systematic overview of current progress in this field. First, a brief review of the development and system architecture of UAV systems for forest fire monitoring, detection, and fighting is provided. Next, technologies related to UAV forest fire monitoring, detection, and fighting are briefly reviewed, including those associated with fire detection, diagnosis, and prognosis, image vibration elimination, and cooperative control of UAVs. The final section outlines existing challenges and potential solutions in the application of UAVs to forest firefighting.

## Wildland fire emissions, carbon, and climate_ Wildland fire detection and burned area in the United States
Year: 2014

Main content:
We describe and compare the major global and regional burned area products and summarize their major findings. The various ground-based reporting systems and the data quality on fire characteristics and burned areas are examined, and we summarize the major knowledge gaps and recommend further improvements in our understanding of fire activity and burned areas.
