## Fire and burn severity assessment: Calibration of Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) with field data
Year: 2019

The paper explores the relationships between field accessible variables and Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) index by using linear mixed-effects models and boosted regression trees, based on data from 28 large fires and 668 field measurements across three countries in southern Europe.

## A disturbance weighting analysis model (DWAM) for mapping wildfire burn severity in the presence of forest disease
Year: 2019

Main content: 
In this study, a Disturbance Weighting Analysis Model (DWAM) is developed for accurately mapping burn severity in a forest landscape that is jointly affected by wildfire and an emerging infectious disease – sudden oak death.

Specifically, it treats burn severity in each basic mapping unit (e.g., 30 m grid from a post-fire Landsat image) as a linear combination of burn severity of trees affected (diseased) and not affected by the disease (healthy), weighted by their areal fractions in the unit. DWAM is calibrated using two types of inputs: i) look-up tables (LUTs) linking burn severity and post-fire spectra for diseased and healthy trees, derived from field observations, hyperspectral sensors [e.g., Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)], and radiative transfer models; and ii) pre-fire fractional maps of diseased and healthy trees, derived by decomposing a pre-fire Landsat image using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA).

## The utility of Random Forests for wildfire severity mapping
Year: 2018

Main content: 
This study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. They collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using ΔNBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE).

## Mapping Burn Severity of Forest Fires in Small Sample Size Scenarios
Year: 2018

Journal: Forest

Main content: 
In order to develop alternative method of mapping burn severity using limited number of field plots, we proposed a support vector regression (SVR) based method using multi-temporal satellite data to map the burn severity, evaluated its performance by calculating correlations between the predicted and the observed Composite Burn Index (CBI), and compared the performance with that of the regression analysis method (based on dNBR).

## Combining Satellite and UAV Imagery to Delineate Forest Cover and Basal Area after Mixed-Severity Fires
Year: 2018

Main content: 
In northern Argentina, the assessment of degraded forests is a big challenge for both science and practice, due to their heterogeneous structure. However, new technologies could contribute to mapping post-disturbance canopy cover and basal area in detail. Therefore, this research assesses whether or not the inclusion of partial cover unmanned aerial vehicle imagery could reduce the classification error of a SPOT6 image used in an area-based inventory.

## Combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 MSI data for initial assessing of burn severity
Year: 2018

Journey: Int J Appl Earth Obs Geoinformation

Main content: 
This work compares two types of satellite-based maps for evaluating fire damage in a large wildfire (around 8000 ha) located in Sierra de Gata (central-western Spain) on 6–11 August 2015. 1) burn severity maps based exclusively on Landsat data; specifically, on differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and on its relative versions (Relative dNBR, RdNBR, and Relativized Burn Ratio, RBR) and 2) burn severity maps based on the same indexes but combining pre-fire data from Landsat 8 OLI with post-fire data from Sentinel-2A MSI data.

## Burn severity metrics in fire-prone pine ecosystems along a climatic gradient using Landsat imagery
Year: 2018

Main content: 
The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of remotely sensed indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS to assess initial burn severity (overall, on vegetation and on soil) in fire-prone pine forests along the Mediterranean-Transition-Oceanic climatic gradient in the Mediterranean Basin. We selected four large wildfires which affected pine forests in a climatic gradient within the Iberian Peninsula. In each wildfire we established CBI plots to obtain field values of three burn severity metrics: site, vegetation and soil burn severity. The ability of 13 spectral indices to match these three field burn severity metrics was compared and their transferability along the climatic gradient assessed using linear regression models. Specifically, we analysed the performance of 12 indices previously used for burn severity assessments (8 reflective, 2 thermal, 2 mixed) and a new reflective index (dNBR-EVI).

Note: 
In this paper, the burn severity is defined as the change in the burn area with respect to the pre-fire situation and operationally denoted as the aboveground and belowground organic matter consumed by fire. And the wildfire have affects on vegetation and soil. As a field measurement, the Composite Burn Index (CBI) is a integrative burn severity indicator by synthesizing several visually estimated metrics of four vegetation strata and soil. Besides, CBI has the advantages of rapid application and known relation with many other impacts on the ecosystems and post-fire recovery. Burn severity based on remote sensing falls into three categories: those based on spectral mixture analysis, radiative transfer models, and spectral indices. 

## A spatial and temporal analysis of forest dynamics using Landsat time-series
Year: 2018

Main content: 
This study proposes an approach for holistically characterising and analysing forest dynamics across large areas and long-time periods using information derived from Landsat timeseries. To achieve this, we first developed a two-phase classification process to predictively map (1) disturbance and recovery levels and (2) disturbance causal agents for multiple detected disturbance events. The model explanatory data included a range of trajectory-based metrics derived from Landsat time-series, while model training and validation data were derived from a human-interpreted reference dataset. While previous studies have often described forest dynamics using some specific spectral change metrics, we demonstrated an ensemble approach to map disturbance and recovery trends (by treating them as a single metric) and to characterise not only abruptly occurring change events (e.g., clear-fell logging and wildfire) but also events of low severity (e.g., prescribed burning and selective logging). In addition, we adopted a space-time data cube concept to simultaneously report both newly detected disturbance events (detected disturbances) as well as events that have previously occurred but are ongoing (ongoing disturbances).

## Using high spatial resolution satellite imagery to map forest burn severity across spatial scales in a Pine Barrens ecosystem
Year: 2017

Main content: 
We assessed a 432 ha forest fire that occurred in April 2012 on Long Island, New York, within the Pine Barrens region. The mapping of forest burn severity was explored here at fine spatial scales, for the first time using remotely sensed spectral indices and a set of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images from bi-temporal — pre- and post-fire event — WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery at 2 m spatial resolution. Two kinds of evaluation: (1) We first evaluated our approach using 1 m by 1 m validation points at the sub-crown scale per severity class (i.e. unburned, low, moderate, and high severity) from the post-fire 0.10 m color aerial ortho-photos; (2) we validated the burn severity mapping of geo-referenced dominant tree crowns (crown scale) and 15 m by 15 m fixed-area plots (inter-crown scale) with the post-fire 0.10 m aerial orthophotos and measured crown information of twenty forest inventory plots.

## Calibrating Satellite-Based Indices of Burn Severity from UAV-Derived Metrics of a Burned Boreal Forest in NWT, Canada
Year: 2017

## Burn severity mapping from Landsat MESMA fraction images and Land Surface Temperature
Year: 2017

Main content:
This study assessed the utility of combined Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images and Land Surface Temperature (LST) to accurately map burn severity. Burn severity degree (low, moderate, and high) was measured 2–3 months after fire in 111 field plots using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). Four fraction images were generated using MESMA from the reflective bands of a post-fire Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) image: char, green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil (NPVS) and shade. The thermal band was converted to LST using a single channel algorithm. Next, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) was used to obtain the probability of each burn severity level from MESMA fraction images and LST. Finally, a burn severity map was generated from the probability images.

## Using one year post-fire fire severity assessments to estimate longer-term effects of fire in conifer forests of northern and eastern California, USA
Year: 2016

Main content: 
In order to explore how fire severity maps relate to longer term post-fire conditions in the absence of management actions, we characterized field-measured fire effects in forests 5–7 years after fire in severity categories as they were mapped with one year post-fire satellite data. The severity maps we used were produced from a relativized differenced normalized burn ratio (RdNBR) derived from Landsat images and calibrated to three severity metrics: composite burn index (CBI), percent change in basal area (BA), and percent change in tree canopy cover (CC).

## Tree mortality based fire severity classification for forest inventories: A Pacific Northwest national forests example
Year: 2016

Main content: 
In the USA Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program is used to generate the national-scale fire severity classification with satellite image change-detection, but it is not clear how much forested area burns in smaller fires or whether ground-based fire severity estimates from a statistical sample of all forest lands might provide additional, useful information. In light of this point, We developed a tree mortality based fire severity classification using remeasured tree data from 10,008 plots in a probabilistic survey of National Forests System (NFS) lands in Oregon and Washington, using 8 tree mortality and abundance metrics. We estimate that 12.5% of NFS forest lands in the region experienced a fire event during 1993–2007, with an annual rate of 0.96%.

## A new burn severity index based on land surface temperature and enhanced vegetation index
Year: 2016

Main content: 
In this paper, a new index is proposed by considering Land Surface Temperature and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) together. The accuracy of the proposed index was evaluated by using 264 composite burn index (CBI) field sample data of the five fires across different regional eco-type areas in the Western United States.

## Object-based assessment of burn severity in diseased forests using high-spatial and high-spectral resolution MASTER airborne imagery
Year: 2015

Main content: 
This study examines the impacts of fire and exotic disease (sudden oak death) on forests, with an emphasis on the assessment of post-fire burn severity in a forest where trees have experienced three stages of disease progression prefire: early-stage (trees retaining dried foliage and fine twigs), middle-stage (trees losing fine crown fuels), and late-stage (trees falling down). (1) The research was conducted by applying Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) to MASTER airborne images that were acquired immediately following the fire for rapid assessment and contained both high-spatial (4 m) and high-spectral (50 bands) resolutions. (2) We also assessed two widely used band reduction algorithms, PCA (principal component analysis) and MNF (minimum noise fraction). To increase computation efficiency, only the top 5 PCA and MNF and top 10 PCA and MNF components were evaluated,

## Mapping burn severity in a disease-impacted forest landscape using Landsat and MASTER imagery
Year: 2015

Main content: 
In this study, we combined (pre- and post-fire) Landsat imagery and (post-fire) high-spectral resolution airborne MASTER data [MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer)/ASTER (advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer)] to map burn severity in a California coastal forest environment, where a non-native forest disease sudden oak death (SOD) was causing substantial tree mortality.

## Estimation and evaluation of multi-decadal fire severity patterns using Landsat sensors
Year: 2015

Main content: 
This study aimed to assess the relationship between the Landsat differenced normalised burn ratio (dNBR) and field measured geometrically structured composite burn index (GeoCBI) for retrospective analysis of fire severity over a 23 year period in sclerophyll woodland and heath ecosystems. Further, we assessed for reduced dNBR fire severity classification accuracies associated with vegetation regrowth at increasing time between ignition and image capture. This was achieved by assessing four Landsat images captured at increasing time since ignition of the most recent burnt area.

## Challenges of assessing fire and burn severity using field measures, remote sensing and modelling
Year: 2014

Main content: 
We highlight the challenges in effective assessment of fire and burn severity in the field and using both remote sensing and simulation models. We draw on diverse recent research for guidance on assessing fire effects on vegetation and soil using field methods, remote sensing and models.

## Atmospheric effects on the performance and threshold extrapolation of multi-temporal Landsat derived dNBR for burn severity assessment
Year: 2014

Main content: 
In this study, we compared the performance of dNBR calculated from six atmospheric correction methods using an optimality approach. The six correction methods included one partial (Top of atmosphere reflectance, TOA), two absolute, and three relative methods. We assessed how the correction methods affected the CBI-dNBR correlation and burn severity mapping in a Chinese boreal forest fire which occurred in 2010.

## Assessing fire severity using imaging spectroscopy data from the Airborne Visible_Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and comparison with multispectral capabilities

## Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to map burn severity levels from Landsat images in Mediterranean countries
Year: 2013

Main content: 
In this work, an unmixing-based methodology was evaluated in three Mediterranean study areas to estimate burn severity from medium spatial resolution optical satellite data. Post-fire Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images were unmixed into four fraction images: non-photosynthetic vegetation and ash (NPV–Ash), green vegetation (GV), soil and shade using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). MESMA decomposes each pixel using different combinations of potential endmembers, overcoming the Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis limitation of using the same number of endmembers to model all image pixels. Next, a decision tree was used to classify the shade normalized fraction images into four classes: unburned and low, moderate, and high levels of burn severity. Finally, the burn severity estimates were validated using error matrix, producer and user accuracies per class, and κ statistic.

## Landscape-scale effects of fire severity on mixed-conifer and red fir forest structure in Yosemite National Park
Year: 2013

Airborne LiDAR data, acquired in July 2010, measured the vertical and horizontal structure of canopy material and landscape patterning of canopy patches and gaps.

## Synergy of VSWIR (0.4–2.5 μm) and MTIR (3.5–12.5 μm) data for post-fire assessments
Year: 2012

We have used MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data over the 2011 Canyon fire in California, USA to evaluate the potential synergy between visible to short-wave infrared (VSWIR, 0.4–2.5 μm) and mid to thermal infrared (MTIR, 3.5–12.5 μm) data in a post-fire assessment task. We applied Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) inputting five endmembers: char, green vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), substrate and shadow.

## Monitoring Trends and Burn Severity (MTBS): Monitoring Wildfire Activity for the Past Quarter Century Using Landsat Data

## An alternative spectral index for rapid fire severity assessments
Year: 2012

The authors have developed an alternative index based on single date short-wave infrared (SWIR) and mid infrared (MIR) reflectance. In contrast with the (d)NBR, the SWIR–MIR index (SMI) is robust against scattering caused by smoke plumes over active fires allowing fire severity assessments to be generated when the area is still obscured by smoke. With the SMI was generated using MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data, the authors performed a regression analysis in which 92 Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) field plots of severity were randomly assigned to two equal halves, a training and a validation dataset, during ten separate trials. The experimental results evaluating the the consistence of SMI, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) to GeoCBI were presented.

## A method for extracting burned areas from Landsat TM_ETM+ images by soft aggregation of multiple Spectral Indices and a region growing algorithm
Year: 2012

Main content: 
In this article we present a multi-criteria approach based on Spectral Indices, soft computing techniques and a region growing algorithm; theoretically this approach relies on the convergence of partial evidence of burning provided by the indices. Our proposal features several innovative aspects: it is flexible in adapting to a variable number of indices and to missing data; it exploits positive and negative evidence (bipolar information) and it offers different criteria for aggregating partial evidence in order to derive the layers of candidate seeds and candidate region growing boundaries. 

## Modeling of multi-strata forest fire severity using Landsat TM Data
Year: 2011

In this study, using field measured fire severity across five forest strata of dominant tree, intermediate-sized tree, shrub, herb, substrate layers, and the aggregated measure of CBI as response variables, we fit statistical models with predictors of Landsat TM bands, Landsat derived NBR or dNBR, image differencing, and image ratioing data. We model multi-strata forest fire in the historical recorded largest wildfire in California, the Big Sur Basin Complex fire. We explore the potential contributions of the post-fire Landsat bands, image differencing, image ratioing to fire severity modeling and compare with the widely used NBR and dNBR. Models using combinations of post-fire Landsat bands perform much better than NBR, dNBR, image differencing, and image ratioing. We predict and map multi-strata forest fire severity across the whole Big Sur fire areas, and find that the overall measure CBI is not optimal to represent multi-strata forest fire severity.

## A time-integrated MODIS burn severity assessment using the multi-temporal differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBRMT)
Year: 2011

Main content:
A multi-temporal burn severity approach based on coarse spatial, high temporal resolution moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery is presented in this study.  The multi-temporal dNBR (dNBRMT) is defined as the 1-year integrated difference between burned pixels and their unique control pixels. These control pixels were selected based on time series similarity and spatial context and reflect how burned pixels would have behaved in the case no fire had occurred.

## The temporal dimension of differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) fire_burn severity studies_ The case of the large 2007 Peloponnese wildfires in Greece
Year: 2010

Main content; 
The temporal dimension of differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) fire/burn severity studies was studied for the case of the large 2007 Peloponnese wildfires in Greece. Fire severity is defined as the degree of environmental change as measured immediately post-fire, whereas burn severity combines the direct fire impact and ecosystems responses. Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI), two pre-/post-fire differenced Thematic Mapper (TM) dNBR assessments and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dNBR time series were used to analyze the temporal dimension. MODIS dNBR time series were calculated based on the difference between the NBR of the burned and control pixels, which were retrieved using time series similarity of a pre-fire year. The analysis incorporated the optimality statistic, which evaluates index performance based on displacements in the mid-infrared–near infrared bi-spectral space.

## Estimating burn severity from Landsat dNBR and RdNBR indices across western Canada
Year: 2010

To predict burn severity, the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) algorithm, derived from Landsat imagery, has been used extensively throughout the wildland fire community. In Canada, few accuracy assessments have been undertaken to compare the accuracy of the dNBR algorithm to its relative form (RdNBR). TThis paper investigates the accuracies of these two algorithms in Canada's National Parks.

## Detecting trends in forest disturbance and recovery using yearly Landsat time series_ 1. LandTrendr — Temporal segmentation algorithms
Year: 2010

Main content: 
We introduce and test LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery), a new approach to extract spectral trajectories of land surface change from yearly Landsat time-series stacks (LTS). The method brings together two themes in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events and smoothing of long-term trends. Our strategy is founded on the recognition that change is not simply a contrast between conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process operating at both fast and slow rates on landscapes. In the LandTrendr approach, we use relative radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to create onthe-fly mosaics of multiple images per year, and extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We then apply temporal segmentation strategies with both regression-based and point-to-point fitting of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory pattern is allowable, we use control parameters and threshold-based filtering to reduce the role of false positive detections. 

## Combining ASTER multispectral imagery analysis and support vector machines for rapid and cost-effective post-fire assessment: a case study from the Greek wildland fires of 2007
Year: 2010

Main content: 
The present study investigates the use of the support vector machine (SVM) classification method with multispectral data from the Advanced Spectral Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) for obtaining a rapid and cost effective post-fire assessment in a Mediterranean setting. Two ASTER scenes were acquired, one before and one closely after the fire episode. Cartography of the burnt area was obtained by classifying each multiband ASTER image into a number of discrete classes using the SVM classifier supported by land use/cover information from the CORINE 2000 land nomenclature.

## Combining spectral mixture analysis and object-based classification for fire severity mapping
Year: 2009

This study shows an accurate and fast methodology in order to evaluate fire severity classes of large forest fires. A single Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper multispectral image was utilized with the aim of mapping fire severity classes (high, moderate and low) using a combined-approach based in a spectral mixing model and object-based image analysis. A large wildfire in the Northwest of Spain was used to test the model. Fraction images obtained by Landsat unmixing were used as input data in the object-based image analysis. A multilevel segmentation and a classification were carried out by using membership functions.

## Landscape Assessment (LA) Sampling and Analysis Methods
Year: 2006

Landscape Assessment primarily addresses the need to identify and quantify fire effects over large areas, at times involving many burns.. In contrast to individual case studies, the ability to compare results is emphasized along with the capacity to aggregate information across broad regions and over time.
In this paper,  burn severity is defined as a scaled index gauging the magnitude of ecological change caused by fire. In the process, two methodologies are integrated. Burn Remote Sensing (BR) involves remote sensing with Landsat 30-meter data and a derived radiometric value called the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). As another one, The Burn Index (BI) adds a complementary field sampling approach, called the Composite Burn Index (CBI), which entails a relatively large plot, independent severity ratings for individual strata, and a synoptic rating for the whole plot area. Plot sampling can be used to calibrate and validate remote sensing results, to relate detected radiometric change to actual fire effects on the ground.
