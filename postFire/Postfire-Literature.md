2019

The paper explores the relationships between field accessible variables and Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) index by using linear mixed-effects models and boosted regression trees, based on data from 28 large fires and 668 field measurements across three countries in southern Europe.

## A disturbance weighting analysis model (DWAM) for mapping wildfire burn severity in the presence of forest disease
2019

In this study, a Disturbance Weighting Analysis Model (DWAM) is developed for accurately mapping burn severity in a forest landscape that is jointly affected by wildfire and an emerging infectious disease – sudden oak death.

Specifically, it treats burn severity in each basic mapping unit (e.g., 30 m grid from a post-fire Landsat image) as a linear combination of burn severity of trees affected (diseased) and not affected by the disease (healthy), weighted by their areal fractions in the unit. DWAM is calibrated using two types of inputs: i) look-up tables (LUTs) linking burn severity and post-fire spectra for diseased and healthy trees, derived from field observations, hyperspectral sensors [e.g., Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)], and radiative transfer models; and ii) pre-fire fractional maps of diseased and healthy trees, derived by decomposing a pre-fire Landsat image using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA).

## The utility of Random Forests for wildfire severity mapping
2018

This study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. They collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using ΔNBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE).

## The Collection 6 MODIS burned area mapping algorithm and product
2018

Here, the authors describe refinements made to the 500m global burned area mapping algorithm that were implemented in late 2016 as part of the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) land-product reprocessing. The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas.

## Mapping Burn Severity of Forest Fires in Small Sample Size Scenarios
2018

Mapping burn severity of forest fires can contribute significantly to understanding, quantifying and monitoring of forest fire severity and its impacts on ecosystems. In recent years, several remote sensing-based methods for mapping burn severity have been reported in the literature, of which the implementations are mainly dependent on several field plots. Therefore, it is a challenge to develop alternative method of mapping burn severity using limited number of field plots. In this study, we proposed a support vector regression based method using multi-temporal satellite data to map the burn severity, evaluated its performance by calculating correlations between the predicted and the observed Composite Burn Index, and compared the performance with that of the regression analysis method (based on dNBR).

## Combining Satellite and UAV Imagery to Delineate Forest Cover and Basal Area after Mixed-Severity Fires
2018

In northern Argentina, the assessment of degraded forests is a big challenge for both science and practice, due to their heterogeneous structure. However, new technologies could contribute to mapping post-disturbance canopy cover and basal area in detail. Therefore, this research assesses whether or not the inclusion of partial cover unmanned aerial vehicle imagery could reduce the classification error of a SPOT6 image used in an area-based inventory.

## Combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 MSI data for initial assessing of burn severity
2018

This work compares two types of satellite-based maps for evaluating fire damage in a large wildfire (around 8000 ha) located in Sierra de Gata (central-western Spain) on 6–11 August 2015. 1) burn severity maps based exclusively on Landsat data; specifically, on differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) and on its relative versions (Relative dNBR, RdNBR, and Relativized Burn Ratio, RBR) and 2) burn severity maps based on the same indexes but combining pre-fire data from Landsat 8 OLI with post-fire data from Sentinel-2A MSI data.

## Burn severity metrics in fire-prone pine ecosystems along a climatic gradient using Landsat imagery
2018

Multispectral imagery is a widely used source of information to address post-fire ecosystem management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of remotely sensed indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS to assess initial burn severity (overall, on vegetation and on soil) in fire-prone pine forests along the MediterraneanTransition-Oceanic climatic gradient in the Mediterranean Basin. We selected four large wildfires which affected pine forests in a climatic gradient within the Iberian Peninsula. In each wildfire we established CBI plots to obtain field values of three burn severity metrics: site, vegetation and soil burn severity. The ability of 13 spectral indices to match these three field burn severity metrics was compared and their transferability along the climatic gradient assessed using linear regression models. Specifically, we analysed the performance of 12 indices previously used for burn severity assessments (8 reflective, 2 thermal, 2 mixed) and a new reflective index (dNBR-EVI).

## A VIIRS direct broadcast algorithm for rapid response mapping of wildfire burned area in the western United States
2018

We present a direct broadcast (DB) rapid response burned area mapping algorithm for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data that combines products driven by the spectral signal of fire-affected areas from both emissive and reflective spectral bands. The algorithm processes VIIRS infrared M-bands (750 m) using spectral ratios of the top of atmosphere reflectance from a single satellite scene to identify pixels exhibiting surface properties consistent with burn scars. Next, this collection of candidate burn scar pixels is screened using a contextual filter based on VIIRS I-band (375 m) active fire detections (AFD) which removes erroneously classified pixels and provides burn scar detections (BSD). The AFD and BSD are then resampled to a 375 m grid and reported jointly as VIIRS burned area (VBA).

## A spatial and temporal analysis of forest dynamics using Landsat time-series
2018

This study proposes an approach for holistically characterising and analysing forest dynamics across large areas and long-time periods using information derived from Landsat timeseries. To achieve this, we first developed a two-phase classification process to predictively map (1) disturbance and recovery levels and (2) disturbance causal agents for multiple detected disturbance events. The model explanatory data included a range of trajectory-based metrics derived from Landsat time-series, while model training and validation data were derived from a human-interpreted reference dataset. While previous studies have often described forest dynamics using some specific spectral change metrics, we demonstrated an ensemble approach to map disturbance and recovery trends (by treating them as a single metric) and to characterise not only abruptly occurring change events (e.g., clear-fell logging and wildfire) but also events of low severity (e.g., prescribed burning and selective logging). In addition, we adopted a space-time data cube concept to simultaneously report both newly detected disturbance events (detected disturbances) as well as events that have previously occurred but are ongoing (ongoing disturbances).

## Landscape Assessment (LA) Sampling and Analysis Methods
2006

Landscape Assessment primarily addresses the need to identify and quantify fire effects over large areas, at times involving many burns.. In contrast to individual case studies, the ability to compare results is emphasized along with the capacity to aggregate information across broad regions and over time.
In this paper,  burn severity is defined as a scaled index gauging the magnitude of ecological change caused by fire. In the process, two methodologies are integrated. Burn Remote Sensing (BR) involves remote sensing with Landsat 30-meter data and a derived radiometric value called the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). As another one, The Burn Index (BI) adds a complementary field sampling approach, called the Composite Burn Index (CBI), which entails a relatively large plot, independent severity ratings for individual strata, and a synoptic rating for the whole plot area. Plot sampling can be used to calibrate and validate remote sensing results, to relate detected radiometric change to actual fire effects on the ground.
