## A disturbance weighting analysis model (DWAM) for mapping wildfire burn severity in the presence of forest disease
Year: 2019

In this study, a Disturbance Weighting Analysis Model (DWAM) is developed for accurately mapping burn severity in a forest landscape that is jointly affected by wildfire and an emerging infectious disease – sudden oak death.

Specifically, it treats burn severity in each basic mapping unit (e.g., 30 m grid from a post-fire Landsat image) as a linear combination of burn severity of trees affected (diseased) and not affected by the disease (healthy), weighted by their areal fractions in the unit. DWAM is calibrated using two types of inputs: i) look-up tables (LUTs) linking burn severity and post-fire spectra for diseased and healthy trees, derived from field observations, hyperspectral sensors [e.g., Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)], and radiative transfer models; and ii) pre-fire fractional maps of diseased and healthy trees, derived by decomposing a pre-fire Landsat image using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA).

## The utility of Random Forests for wildfire severity mapping
Year: 2018

This study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. They collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using ΔNBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE).

## The Collection 6 MODIS burned area mapping algorithm and product
Year: 2018

Here, the authors describe refinements made to the 500m global burned area mapping algorithm that were implemented in late 2016 as part of the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) land-product reprocessing. The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas.

## Mapping Burn Severity of Forest Fires in Small Sample Size Scenarios
Year: 2018

Mapping burn severity of forest fires can contribute significantly to understanding, quantifying and monitoring of forest fire severity and its impacts on ecosystems. In recent years, several remote sensing-based methods for mapping burn severity have been reported in the literature, of which the implementations are mainly dependent on several field plots. Therefore, it is a challenge to develop alternative method of mapping burn severity using limited number of field plots. In this study, we proposed a support vector regression based method using multi-temporal satellite data to map the burn severity, evaluated its performance by calculating correlations between the predicted and the observed Composite Burn Index, and compared the performance with that of the regression analysis method (based on dNBR).

## Combining Satellite and UAV Imagery to Delineate Forest Cover and Basal Area after Mixed-Severity Fires
Year: 2018

In northern Argentina, the assessment of degraded forests is a big challenge for both science and practice, due to their heterogeneous structure. However, new technologies could contribute to mapping post-disturbance canopy cover and basal area in detail. Therefore, this research assesses whether or not the inclusion of partial cover unmanned aerial vehicle imagery could reduce the classification error of a SPOT6 image used in an area-based inventory.

## Combination of Landsat and Sentinel-2 MSI data for initial assessing of burn severity

## Burn severity metrics in fire-prone pine ecosystems along a climatic gradient using Landsat imagery
Year: 2018

Main content: 
Multispectral imagery is a widely used source of information to address post-fire ecosystem management. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of remotely sensed indices derived from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS to assess initial burn severity (overall, on vegetation and on soil) in fire-prone pine forests along the Mediterranean-Transition-Oceanic climatic gradient in the Mediterranean Basin. We selected four large wildfires which affected pine forests in a climatic gradient within the Iberian Peninsula. In each wildfire we established CBI plots to obtain field values of three burn severity metrics: site, vegetation and soil burn severity. The ability of 13 spectral indices to match these three field burn severity metrics was compared and their transferability along the climatic gradient assessed using linear regression models. Specifically, we analysed the performance of 12 indices previously used for burn severity assessments (8 reflective, 2 thermal, 2 mixed) and a new reflective index (dNBR-EVI).

Note: 
In this paper, the burn severity is defined as the change in the burn area with respect to the pre-fire situation and operationally denoted as the aboveground and belowground organic matter consumed by fire. And the wildfire have affects on vegetation and soil. As a field measurement, the Composite Burn Index (CBI) is a integrative burn severity indicator by synthesizing several visually estimated metrics of four vegetation strata and soil. Besides, CBI has the advantages of rapid application and known relation with many other impacts on the ecosystems and post-fire recovery. Burn severity based on remote sensing falls into three categories: those based on spectral mixture analysis, radiative transfer models, and spectral indices. 

The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of remotely sensed indices derived from Landsat sensors for initial burn severity assessments in fire-prone ecosystems dominated by Pinus species along the Mediterranean-Transition-Oceanic climatic gradient.

## Analyzing spatial and temporal variability in short-term rates of post-fire vegetation return from Landsat time series
Year: 2018
Journal: Remote Sensing of Environment

Main content: 
In this research, we used three spectral recovery metrics derived from an annual Landsatbased per-pixel Normalized Burn Ratio time series to determine trends in the short-term rates of spectral recovery for areas disturbed by wildfire (1986–2006), as assessed using a series of 5-year post-disturbance windows to observe forest recovery trends. 

## A VIIRS direct broadcast algorithm for rapid response mapping of wildfire burned area in the western United States
Year: 2018

We present a direct broadcast (DB) rapid response burned area mapping algorithm for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data that combines products driven by the spectral signal of fire-affected areas from both emissive and reflective spectral bands. The algorithm processes VIIRS infrared M-bands (750 m) using spectral ratios of the top of atmosphere reflectance from a single satellite scene to identify pixels exhibiting surface properties consistent with burn scars. Next, this collection of candidate burn scar pixels is screened using a contextual filter based on VIIRS I-band (375 m) active fire detections (AFD) which removes erroneously classified pixels and provides burn scar detections (BSD). The AFD and BSD are then resampled to a 375 m grid and reported jointly as VIIRS burned area (VBA).

## A spatial and temporal analysis of forest dynamics using Landsat time-series
Year: 2018

Main content: 
This study proposes an approach for holistically characterising and analysing forest dynamics across large areas and long-time periods using information derived from Landsat timeseries. To achieve this, we first developed a two-phase classification process to predictively map (1) disturbance and recovery levels and (2) disturbance causal agents for multiple detected disturbance events. The model explanatory data included a range of trajectory-based metrics derived from Landsat time-series, while model training and validation data were derived from a human-interpreted reference dataset. While previous studies have often described forest dynamics using some specific spectral change metrics, we demonstrated an ensemble approach to map disturbance and recovery trends (by treating them as a single metric) and to characterise not only abruptly occurring change events (e.g., clear-fell logging and wildfire) but also events of low severity (e.g., prescribed burning and selective logging). In addition, we adopted a space-time data cube concept to simultaneously report both newly detected disturbance events (detected disturbances) as well as events that have previously occurred but are ongoing (ongoing disturbances).

## A data mining approach for global burned area mapping
Year: 2018

The aim of this work is to explore how four different classification algorithms, such as Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Networks (NN) and a well-known decision tree algorithm (C5.0), for classifying burned areas at global scale through a data mining methodology using 2008 MODIS data. A training database consisting of burned and unburned pixels was created from 130 Landsat scenes. The ability of the algorithms to cope with hightly unbalanced database was evaluated. Attribute selection was performed using three filters to remove potential noise and to reduce the dimensionality of the data: Random Forest, entropy-based filter, and logistic regression. Models were trained using an 80% of the database following a ten-fold approach to reduce possible overfitting and to select the optimum parameters. Finally, the performance fo the algorithms was evaluated over six different regions using official statistics where they are available and benchmark burned area products, namely MCD45 (V5.1) and MCD64 (V6).

## Using high spatial resolution satellite imagery to map forest burn severity across spatial scales in a Pine Barrens ecosystem
Year: 2017

We assessed a 432 ha forest fire that occurred in April 2012 on Long Island, New York, within the Pine Barrens region. The mapping of forest burn severity was explored here at fine spatial scales, for the first time using remotely sensed spectral indices and a set of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images from bi-temporal — pre- and post-fire event — WorldView-2 (WV-2) imagery at 2 m spatial resolution. Two kinds of evaluation: (1) We first evaluated our approach using 1 m by 1 m validation points at the sub-crown scale per severity class (i.e. unburned, low, moderate, and high severity) from the post-fire 0.10 m color aerial ortho-photos; (2) we validated the burn severity mapping of geo-referenced dominant tree crowns (crown scale) and 15 m by 15 m fixed-area plots (inter-crown scale) with the post-fire 0.10 m aerial orthophotos and measured crown information of twenty forest inventory plots.

## Testing a Landsat-based approach for mapping disturbance causality in U.S. forests
Year: 2017

In this study, a two-step modeling approach was used to map the type and timing of forest disturbances occurring between 1984 and 2010 in ten Landsat scenes located in diverse forest systems of the conterminous U.S. In step one, Random Forest (RF) models were developed to predict the presence of five forest disturbance agents (conversion, fire, harvest, stress and wind) and stable (i.e. undisturbed) forest. Models were developed using a suite of predictors including spectral change metrics derived from a nonparametric shape-restricted spline fitting algorithm, as well as several topographic and biophysical variables which potentially influence the initiation and/or spread of forest disturbance agents. Step two involved applying a rule-based model to the spectrally-based shape parameters (e.g. shape type, year and duration) to assign a year to the disturbance types and locations predicted in step one.

## Mapping burned areas using dense time-series of Landsat data
Year: 2017

In this paper, the authors present an algorithm that identifies burned areas in dense time-series of Landsat data to produce the Landsat Burned Area Essential Climate Variable (BAECV) products. The algorithm uses gradient boosted regression models to generate burn probability surfaces using band values and spectral indices from individual Landsat scenes, lagged reference conditions, and change metrics between the scene and reference predictors. Burn classifications are generated from the burn probability surfaces using pixel-level thresholding in combination with a region growing process.

## Burn severity mapping from Landsat MESMA fraction images and Land Surface Temperature
Year: 2017

This study assessed the utility of combined Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) fraction images and Land Surface Temperature (LST) to accurately map burn severity. Burn severity degree (low, moderate, and high) was measured 2–3 months after fire in 111 field plots using the Composite Burn Index (CBI). Four fraction images were generated using MESMA from the reflective bands of a post-fire Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) image: char, green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil (NPVS) and shade. The thermal band was converted to LST using a single channel algorithm. Next, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) was used to obtain the probability of each burn severity level from MESMA fraction images and LST. Finally, a burn severity map was generated from the probability images.

## Assessment of VIIRS 375 m active fire detection product for direct burned area mapping

The accuracy of the burned area estimations was assessed by comparison with Landsat-8 supervised burned area classification.

## Assessment of forest recovery at Wu-Ling fire scars in Taiwan using multi-temporal Landsat imagery
Year: 2017

Time series Landsat imagery during 1994–2015 were used to observe the forest recovery of Wu-Ling fire scars in Taiwan. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) was reconceptualized to propose the indices of post-fire recovery condition and resilience, and Burn Recovery Ratio (BRR) was newly developed as the indicator to better clarify the forest recovery
status. Results show that BRR coupled with dNBR (bi-temporal NBR) could quantitatively describe the level of forest recovery through the heterogeneity of forest landscape which is confirmed by field investigation. Time of complete recovery which is a indicator of post-fire resilience, were predicted using curve-fitting of forest recovery trajectories to the exponential decay function, with its spatial distribution revealing the patterns of post-fire recovery across the fire scars.

## Tree mortality based fire severity classification for forest inventories A Pacific Northwest national forests example 
Year: 2016

In the USA Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) program is used to generate the national-scale fire severity classification with satellite image change-detection, but it is not clear how much forested area burns in smaller fires or whether ground-based fire severity estimates from a statistical sample of all forest lands might provide additional, useful information. In light of this point, We developed a tree mortality based fire severity classification using remeasured tree data from 10,008 plots in a probabilistic survey of National Forests System (NFS) lands in Oregon and Washington, using 8 tree mortality and abundance metrics. We estimate that 12.5% of NFS forest lands in the region experienced a fire event during 1993–2007, with an annual rate of 0.96%.

## Mapping a burned forest area from Landsat TM data by multiple methods
Year: 2016

In this study, focusing on the most serious forest fire in the history of P. R. China which occurred in this region, we made use of two Landsat-5 TM (Thematic Mapper) images, and proposed to map the overall burned area and burned forest area by multiple methods. During the mapping, the fire perimeter, as well as rivers, roads and urban areas were first extracted and masked visually, and then four indices of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Enhanced Vegetation Index, Vegetation Fractional Cover and Disturbance Index were calculated. For each index, the optimal threshold for separating burned from unburned forest area was determined using their histograms. For comparison, threshold segmentation using single-band reflectance was performed, in addition to a Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC) based supervised classification of all features and forest area alone; their accuracies were also evaluated and analysed.

## Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to map burn severity levels from Landsat images in Mediterranean countries
Year: 2013

Main content: 
In this work, an unmixing-based methodology was evaluated in three Mediterranean study areas to estimate burn severity from medium spatial resolution optical satellite data. Post-fire Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images were unmixed into four fraction images: non-photosynthetic vegetation and ash (NPV–Ash), green vegetation (GV), soil and shade using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). MESMA decomposes each pixel using different combinations of potential endmembers, overcoming the Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis limitation of using the same number of endmembers to model all image pixels. Next, a decision tree was used to classify the shade normalized fraction images into four classes: unburned and low, moderate, and high levels of burn severity. Finally, the burn severity estimates were validated using error matrix, producer and user accuracies per class, and κ statistic.

Year: 2012

The authors have developed an alternative index based on single date short-wave infrared (SWIR) and mid infrared (MIR) reflectance. In contrast with the (d)NBR, the SWIR–MIR index (SMI) is robust against scattering caused by smoke plumes over active fires allowing fire severity assessments to be generated when the area is still obscured by smoke. With the SMI was generated using MODIS/ASTER (MASTER) airborne simulator data, the authors performed a regression analysis in which 92 Geo Composite Burn Index (GeoCBI) field plots of severity were randomly assigned to two equal halves, a training and a validation dataset, during ten separate trials. The experimental results evaluating the the consistence of SMI, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) to GeoCBI were presented.

## Modeling of multi-strata forest fire severity using Landsat TM Data
Year: 2011

In this study, using field measured fire severity across five forest strata of dominant tree, intermediate-sized tree, shrub, herb, substrate layers, and the aggregated measure of CBI as response variables, we fit statistical models with predictors of Landsat TM bands, Landsat derived NBR or dNBR, image differencing, and image ratioing data. We model multi-strata forest fire in the historical recorded largest wildfire in California, the Big Sur Basin Complex fire. We explore the potential contributions of the post-fire Landsat bands, image differencing, image ratioing to fire severity modeling and compare with the widely used NBR and dNBR. Models using combinations of post-fire Landsat bands perform much better than NBR, dNBR, image differencing, and image ratioing. We predict and map multi-strata forest fire severity across the whole Big Sur fire areas, and find that the overall measure CBI is not optimal to represent multi-strata forest fire severity.

## Landscape Assessment (LA) Sampling and Analysis Methods
Year: 2006

Landscape Assessment primarily addresses the need to identify and quantify fire effects over large areas, at times involving many burns.. In contrast to individual case studies, the ability to compare results is emphasized along with the capacity to aggregate information across broad regions and over time.
In this paper,  burn severity is defined as a scaled index gauging the magnitude of ecological change caused by fire. In the process, two methodologies are integrated. Burn Remote Sensing (BR) involves remote sensing with Landsat 30-meter data and a derived radiometric value called the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). As another one, The Burn Index (BI) adds a complementary field sampling approach, called the Composite Burn Index (CBI), which entails a relatively large plot, independent severity ratings for individual strata, and a synoptic rating for the whole plot area. Plot sampling can be used to calibrate and validate remote sensing results, to relate detected radiometric change to actual fire effects on the ground.
