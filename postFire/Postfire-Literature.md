## Fire and burn severity assessment: Calibration of Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) with field data
2019

The paper explores the relationships between field accessible variables and Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR) index by using linear mixed-effects models and boosted regression trees, based on data from 28 large fires and 668 field measurements across three countries in southern Europe.

## A disturbance weighting analysis model (DWAM) for mapping wildfire burn severity in the presence of forest disease
2019

In this study, a Disturbance Weighting Analysis Model (DWAM) is developed for accurately mapping burn severity in a forest landscape that is jointly affected by wildfire and an emerging infectious disease – sudden oak death.

Specifically, it treats burn severity in each basic mapping unit (e.g., 30 m grid from a post-fire Landsat image) as a linear combination of burn severity of trees affected (diseased) and not affected by the disease (healthy), weighted by their areal fractions in the unit. DWAM is calibrated using two types of inputs: i) look-up tables (LUTs) linking burn severity and post-fire spectra for diseased and healthy trees, derived from field observations, hyperspectral sensors [e.g., Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS)], and radiative transfer models; and ii) pre-fire fractional maps of diseased and healthy trees, derived by decomposing a pre-fire Landsat image using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA).

## The utility of Random Forests for wildfire severity mapping
2018

This study assesses the performance of the Random Forest classifier (RF) for improving the accuracy of satellite based wildfire severity mapping across heterogeneous landscapes using Landsat imagery. They collected point based fire severity training data (n = 10,855) from sixteen large wildfires occurring across south-eastern Australia between 2006 and 2016. The predictive accuracy of fire severity classification using ΔNBR and the RF incorporating numerous spectral indices, was assessed using bootstrapping and cross validation. Image acquisition and index calculation for each fire was undertaken in Google Earth Engine (GEE).

## Economic Assessment of Fire Damage to Urban Forest in the Wildland–Urban Interface Using Planet Satellites Constellation Images
2018 bad

we take advantage of frequent (i.e., ca. daily), high-spatial-resolution (3 m) imagery acquired from a constellation of nano-satellites operated by Planet Labs (“Planet”) to assess fire damage to urban trees in the wildland-urban interface of a Mediterranean city in Israel (Haifa).


## Landscape Assessment (LA) Sampling and Analysis Methods
2006

Landscape Assessment primarily addresses the need to identify and quantify fire effects over large areas, at times involving many burns.. In contrast to individual case studies, the ability to compare results is emphasized along with the capacity to aggregate information across broad regions and over time.
In this paper,  burn severity is defined as a scaled index gauging the magnitude of ecological change caused by fire. In the process, two methodologies are integrated. Burn Remote Sensing (BR) involves remote sensing with Landsat 30-meter data and a derived radiometric value called the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). As another one, The Burn Index (BI) adds a complementary field sampling approach, called the Composite Burn Index (CBI), which entails a relatively large plot, independent severity ratings for individual strata, and a synoptic rating for the whole plot area. Plot sampling can be used to calibrate and validate remote sensing results, to relate detected radiometric change to actual fire effects on the ground.
