## Satellite-Based Evaluation of the Post-Fire Recovery Process from the Worst Forest Fire Case in South Korea
Year: 2018

Journey: Remote Sensing

Main content:
We used three indices, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Gross Primary Production (GPP), to temporally monitor a burned area in terms of its moisture condition, vegetation biomass, and photosynthetic activity, respectively. The change of those three indices by forest recovery processes was relatively analyzed using an unburned reference area.

Year: 2018

Journey: Remote Sensing of Environment

Main content:
Here, we examined whether the combined use of multi-sensor remote sensing techniques to separate canopy recovery from understory recovery would enable to quantify post-fire forest recovery rate spanning a large gradient in burn severity over large-scales.

## Effects of Burn Severity and Environmental Conditions on Post-Fire Regeneration in Siberian Larch Forest

Year: 2018

Main Content: 
Three indicators are proposed: the novel Cumulative Relative Recovery Index (CRRI), measuring the (mid-long term) extent and completeness of recovery; the Recovery Trend Index (RTI), measuring the steepness of the mid-term post-fire recovery trend; and the Half Recovery Time index (HRT), a measure of the short-term recovery rate. We used Random Forest (RF) models to predict the observed recovery patterns and ranked the predictive importance of several candidate explanatory factors. The performance of RF models ranged from good (CRRI, RTI) to moderate (HRT). Three sets of predictive variables consistently ranked higher: fire traits, landscape composition, and post-fire climatic conditions.
## Analyzing spatial and temporal variability in short-term rates of post-fire vegetation return from Landsat time series
Year: 2018

Journal: Remote Sensing of Environment

Main content: 
In this research, we used three spectral recovery metrics derived from an annual Landsatbased per-pixel Normalized Burn Ratio time series to determine trends in the short-term rates of spectral recovery for areas disturbed by wildfire (1986–2006), as assessed using a series of 5-year post-disturbance windows to observe forest recovery trends. 


## Effects of Burn Severity and Environmental Conditions on Post-Fire Regeneration in Siberian Larch Forest
Year: 2017

Journey: Forest

Main content: 
We evaluated multiple factors influencing patterns of variability in a post-fire boreal Larch (Larix sibirica) forest in Siberia. A time-series of remote sensing images was analyzed to estimate post-fire recovery as a response variable across the burned area in 1996.

## Assessment of forest recovery at Wu-Ling fire scars in Taiwan using multi-temporal Landsat imagery
Year: 2017

Time series Landsat imagery during 1994–2015 were used to observe the forest recovery of Wu-Ling fire scars in Taiwan. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) was reconceptualized to propose the indices of post-fire recovery condition and resilience, and Burn Recovery Ratio (BRR) was newly developed as the indicator to better clarify the forest recovery status. Results show that BRR coupled with dNBR (bi-temporal NBR) could quantitatively describe the level of forest recovery through the heterogeneity of forest landscape which is confirmed by field investigation. Time of complete recovery which is a indicator of post-fire resilience, were predicted using curve-fitting of forest recovery trajectories to the exponential decay function, with its spatial distribution revealing the patterns of post-fire recovery across the fire scars.

## Resilience of Mediterranean terrestrial ecosystems and fire severity in semiarid areas: Responses of Aleppo pine forests in the short, mid and long term
Year: 2016

Journey: Science of the Total Environment

Main content: 
This study assessed the resilience concept by focusing on the recovery of ecosystem functions and services, measured as changes in the composition and diversity of plant community vegetation and structure. This will be validated in the long term as a model of ecosystem response. Also, depending on the pre-fire characteristics of vegetation, fire severity and the post-fire management, this approach will lead to tools that can be applied to implement post-fire restoration efforts in order to help decision making in planning activities.

## Forest disturbances, forest recovery, and changes in forest types across the Carpathian ecoregion from 1985 to 2010 based on Landsat image composites
Year: 2014

Main content: 
In this study we analyzed changes in forest types, forest disturbances, and forest recovery for the Carpathian ecoregion in Eastern Europe. We generated a series of image composites at five year intervals between 1985 and 2010 and utilized a hybrid analysis strategy consisting of radiometric change classification, post-classification comparison and continuous index- and
segment-based post-disturbance recovery assessment. For validation of the disturbance map we used a pointbased accuracy assessment, and assessed the accuracy of our forest type maps using forest inventory data and statistically sampled ground truth data for 2010. 

## Mapping post-fire forest regeneration and vegetation recovery using a combination of very high spatial resolution and hyperspectral satellite imagery
Year: 2013

Main content: 
The aim of this work was to map post-fire forest regeneration and vegetation recovery on the Mediterranean island of Thasos by using a combination of very high spatial (VHS) resolution (QuickBird) and hyperspectral (EO-1 Hyperion) imagery and by employing object-based image analysis. More specifically, the work focused on (1) the separation and mapping of three major post-fire classes (forest regeneration, other vegetation recovery, unburned vegetation) existing within the fire perimeter, and (2) the differentiation and mapping of the two main forest regeneration classes, namely, Pinus brutia regeneration, and Pinus nigra regeneration. The data used in this study consisted of satellite images and field observations of homogeneous regenerated and revegetated areas.

## Spectral mixture analysis to assess post-fire vegetation regeneration using Landsat Thematic Mapper imagery_ Accounting for soil brightness variation
Year: 2012

Main content: 
Using a combination of field and simulation techniques this study aimed to account for the impact of background brightness variability on SMA model performance. The field data consisted out of a spectral library of in situ measured reflectance signals of vegetation and substrate and 78 line transect plots. In addition, a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene was employed in the study. A simple SMA, in which each constituting terrain feature is represented by its mean spectral signature, a multiple endmember SMA (MESMA) and a segmented SMA, which accounts for soil brightness variations by forcing the substrate endmember choice based on ancillary data (lithological map), were applied. In the study area two main spectrally different lithological units were present: relatively bright limestone and relatively dark flysch (sand-siltstone). 

## Assessing post-fire vegetation recovery using red–near infrared vegetation indices_ Accounting for background and vegetation variability
Year: 2012

Main content: 
In this context, 13 red–near infrared (R–NIR) vegetation indices (VIs) were evaluated. Some of these indices, the so called Soil-Adjusted VIs (SAVIs), attempt to minimize the influence of background variability, however, so far the impact of the variability in spectral response between different vegetation species on index performance has not yet been rigorously assessed. Using a combination of field and simulation techniques this study accounts for the impact of both background and vegetation variability on index performance. The field data included a spectral library (59 vegetation and 29 substrate signals) and 78 line transect plots. One Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scene of July 2010, 3 years after the fire event, was employed in the study.

Main content: 
In this paper, we describe how to use TimeSync to collect data over forested plots in Oregon and Washington, USA, examine the data collected with it, and then compare those data with the output from a new LTS algorithm, LandTrendr, described in a companion paper (Kennedy et al., 2010). 

## Analyzing the Impacts of Frequency and Severity of Forest Fire on the Recovery of Disturbed Forest using Landsat Time Series and EO-1 Hyperion in the Southern Brazilian Amazon
2011

Main content: 
The authors
analyzed impacts of fire frequency and severity within recovering forests in the Amazon region using remote sensing. A multispectral Landsat time series dataset was used to reconstruct the fire history from 1990 to 2002 in a portion of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Five narrowband vegetation indices were then calculated from a hyperspectral Earth Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion image for spectral analysis of physiological characteristics of fire-disturbed forests and their recovery. 

## Detecting trends in forest disturbance and recovery using yearly Landsat time series_ 1. LandTrendr — Temporal segmentation algorithms
Year: 2010

Main content: 
We introduce and test LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery), a new approach to extract spectral trajectories of land surface change from yearly Landsat time-series stacks (LTS). The method brings together two themes in time-series analysis of LTS: capture of short-duration events and smoothing of long-term trends. Our strategy is founded on the recognition that change is not simply a contrast between conditions at two points in time, but rather a continual process operating at both fast and slow rates on landscapes. In the LandTrendr approach, we use relative radiometric normalization and simple cloud screening rules to create onthe-fly mosaics of multiple images per year, and extract temporal trajectories of spectral data on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We then apply temporal segmentation strategies with both regression-based and point-to-point fitting of spectral indices as a function of time, allowing capture of both slowly-evolving processes, such as regrowth, and abrupt events, such as forest harvest. Because any temporal trajectory pattern is allowable, we use control parameters and threshold-based filtering to reduce the role of false positive detections.
