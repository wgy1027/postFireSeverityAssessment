## Satellite-Based Evaluation of the Post-Fire Recovery Process from the Worst Forest Fire Case in South Korea
Year: 2018

Journey: Remote Sensing

Main content:
We used three indices, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Gross Primary Production (GPP), to temporally monitor a burned area in terms of its moisture condition, vegetation biomass, and photosynthetic activity, respectively. The change of those three indices by forest recovery processes was relatively analyzed using an unburned reference area.

## Measuring short-term post-fire forest recovery across a burn severity gradient in a mixed pine-oak forest using multi-sensor remote sensing techniques
Year: 2018

Journey: Remote Sensing of Environment

Main content:
Here, we examined whether the combined use of multi-sensor remote sensing techniques to separate canopy recovery from understory recovery would enable to quantify post-fire forest recovery rate spanning a large gradient in burn severity over large-scales.

## Effects of Burn Severity and Environmental Conditions on Post-Fire Regeneration in Siberian Larch Forest

Year: 2018

Main Content: 
Three indicators are proposed: the novel Cumulative Relative Recovery Index (CRRI), measuring the (mid-long term) extent and completeness of recovery; the Recovery Trend Index (RTI), measuring the steepness of the mid-term post-fire recovery trend; and the Half Recovery Time index (HRT), a measure of the short-term recovery rate. We used Random Forest (RF) models to predict the observed recovery patterns and ranked the predictive importance of several candidate explanatory factors. The performance of RF models ranged from good (CRRI, RTI) to moderate (HRT). Three sets of predictive variables consistently ranked higher: fire traits, landscape composition, and post-fire climatic conditions.
## Analyzing spatial and temporal variability in short-term rates of post-fire vegetation return from Landsat time series
Year: 2018

Journal: Remote Sensing of Environment

Main content: 
In this research, we used three spectral recovery metrics derived from an annual Landsatbased per-pixel Normalized Burn Ratio time series to determine trends in the short-term rates of spectral recovery for areas disturbed by wildfire (1986–2006), as assessed using a series of 5-year post-disturbance windows to observe forest recovery trends. 


## Effects of Burn Severity and Environmental Conditions on Post-Fire Regeneration in Siberian Larch Forest
Year: 2017

Journey: Forest

Main content: 
We evaluated multiple factors influencing patterns of variability in a post-fire boreal Larch (Larix sibirica) forest in Siberia. A time-series of remote sensing images was analyzed to estimate post-fire recovery as a response variable across the burned area in 1996.

## Assessment of forest recovery at Wu-Ling fire scars in Taiwan using multi-temporal Landsat imagery
Year: 2017

Time series Landsat imagery during 1994–2015 were used to observe the forest recovery of Wu-Ling fire scars in Taiwan. Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) was reconceptualized to propose the indices of post-fire recovery condition and resilience, and Burn Recovery Ratio (BRR) was newly developed as the indicator to better clarify the forest recovery status. Results show that BRR coupled with dNBR (bi-temporal NBR) could quantitatively describe the level of forest recovery through the heterogeneity of forest landscape which is confirmed by field investigation. Time of complete recovery which is a indicator of post-fire resilience, were predicted using curve-fitting of forest recovery trajectories to the exponential decay function, with its spatial distribution revealing the patterns of post-fire recovery across the fire scars. 

## A nationwide annual characterization of 25 years of forest disturbance and recovery for Canada using Landsat time series
2017

Main content:
In this research, we utilize the outputs of the Composite2Change, or C2C, algorithm that leverages the extensive Landsat archive to produce annual, gap-free, surface reflectance composites to date and label disturbance types and to characterize vegetation recovery over the N650 million ha of Canada's forested ecosystems.
